Are you fine now?	Today,as i was leaving for work in the morning,i had a tire burst in the middle of a busy road. That scared the hell out of me!
Cool :) Is your car damaged a lot?	Yeah,i'm doing alright now, but with minor injuries.
That's funny, hope he didn't give you a heart attack.	A few weeks ago, I was walking through my hallway, minding my own business, when all of a sudden a hand reached out from under a table and grabbed my ankle. I was so suprised. I thought i was got. Turns out, it was my son.
I would probably scream also.	I may have let out a scream that will have him question my manhood for the rest of our lives, lol.
Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going?	"I'm overly excited because will be flying outside the country for the first time tomorrow."".  Please enter here..."
You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels!	Traveling to South Africa then to Ghana. Also my first time visiting Africa
Thats horrible, hope he is ok.	One time, I was holding my son over my head, when all of a sudden, he threw up all over my face. I almost cried.
I see, glad he is ok.	yeah, he had just drank a bottle, and I was moving him around like an airplane. In retrospect. I deserved it.
Hi, how are you?	Hello
That was kind of you, I am sure they appreciated that!	Im doing great i just wanted to tell you a short story about a time i helped an elderly lady.  She was struggling to carry her bags from a trip she had took.  I helped her carry them to her door ! Pretty good feeling when you help others
My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!	I went to the Kemah boardwalk with my boyfriend. It made me think of times I went vacationing with my family.
Yes I love to reminice	All I thought about was being at home again and being able to relive those moments.
Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?	My dog died a few years ago after I had my son.  It was right around Christmas and I had the dog for fourteen years.
I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?	The dog was there with my throughout my life. He saw me through boyfriends and friends.
Hello How are you and what is your story chat about today?	hello
OMG wow.... i hope you got it open quick!	I locked my keys in my car about a week ago. It was 95 degrees outside and I was at the store getting groceries.
Hi, a few months ago, my mother found some stray dogs that were starving, so she told us about them. Of course, we brought the poor babies to our house, a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet.	Hello
Yes, I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets, so I wasn't going to keep them, but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together.	Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in
That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet.	I wanted to let you know recently i saw a younger man helping an old lady who fell to the ground. Its nice to see people helping others
Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. :)	yeah it made me feel great :)
Thats sweet that you remember that, how old were you?	So this one time my grandmother gave me a scooter, it was the best gift ever, I was really happy
I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p	I was around 10 years old I think, it was quite a long time ago for me now haha!
That's wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?	I was extremely lucky when my girlfriend said she would date me, she is my world now.
Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!	We have been together for close to 5 months now, so not very long haha!
congratualtions. what do you do?	I started a new job about a month ago and it's going really well.
oh wow. we're practically neighbors.	I work in I.T. for the provincial government in Canada :)
How big was the deck?	So my friend built a deck and it turned out amazing, I didn't know he had it in him.
Wow that is big.	I think its probably about 20 feet by 25 feet? I'm bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah
What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.	My girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot.
Oh wow, I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.	Well, when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish, I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.
Thats great. Did you create the script?	I have to fill out forms all day so I scripted a program that does half of it for me and it works really well!
I love google. It is my favorite search engine.	Yeah, had to google a bit of it but it worked out well.
Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear?	I was extremely relieved when I found out my dad beat cancer.
Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :)	About 2 years now.
Have you tried to call her?	My girlfriend hasn't talked to me in a few days and I'm struggling to keep it together but I am at the moment.
Maybe give her space.	I have, but she's going through a rough time and likes to seclude herself.
What birthstone is it.	My grandma gave me a stone and said it was my birthstone and I hold it very close to my heart now.
What birthstone is it?	It is amethyst.
I love to play Madden.	I play some competitive video games and I think I'm pretty good at one of them.
Yes, every day.	Do you play Madden often?
Where is she?	I haven't been able to talk to my girlfriend in a few days and it's making me quite sad.
Just give her space.	She's in the same city as me, but she's going through a hard time and has decided to seclude herself so I can't reach her.
Thats great.	My daughter is very smart. She learns things really quickly.
Did you teach her?	Yes, she picks up on things that I didn't even think she knew about.
Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!	I can't believe how big the waves are. Hurricane Chris amped up my summer.
That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat.	Yes, I've been surfing for ever. Only three of us in the water.
Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!	You are never to old to start. I'm teaching my mate and he is 70 I think. Hopefully I have a boat soon.'
Wow, 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.	I usually hate to ask for help, so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help.
Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours?	That is so exciting, congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family, so having a great group of friends is really important to us.
I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult.	Get involved in something. Church, a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups, for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!
That sounds fun, I was never any good at painting	I went to this thing called a Paint Night and I ended up making an okay looking painting
That probably helps a good deal!	I am not either, but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)
I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!	That Jerk, Did'nt even wave when he cut me off.
That is terrible, he could have hurt the horse!	After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy.
Nice, congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?	So I got a new job recently, and I got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what I was expecting!
Awesome, I hope the job goes great for you!	It's pretty good so far, I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!
Thats sad, hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you	When I was a little girl, our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn't think he would come home so we adopted another kitten.
Haha thats crazy, I hope they became best friends, I love cats.	Well, we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home, or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.
I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!	I really liked having my mom here. She helped with the kids but then when she left I missed it.
Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.	Yes, the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.
An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.	This one time I spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys.
I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.	Its really not, the foods not worth that long of a wait.
Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?	I went to a nice work dinner with my husband. I can't get over how stupid I made myself look.
Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.	I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday.
That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!	A lady was having issues with a program on her computer, and I solved it with no problems!
Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?	That sounds unpleasant, did you get in afterwards?
Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen.	I'm so angry they end up charging me 255 in charges that did not belong to me.
Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.	I called them and did not hold back.
It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?	My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired, but she got one right off the bat!
That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?	I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.
I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.	My girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital, and I go and see her as often as I can.
She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!	Thanks, I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can, she's my world.
I am very nostalgic too, that must be a fun time!	I love going to places that I explored and play at as a child. Every time I go, I always feel super nostalgic.
That is true, but it is part of life, but it is cool to see things again, regain perspective	Yes, until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there, and you start feeling old
I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.	I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend, but when my girlfriend first moved into my house, I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way, and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.
Yes, sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!	I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath, and realize its just things, and it was just me being reluctant to change.
I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life	I always hate thinking that my son is getting old. Just like a few days ago, I was looking at some of my sons old clothes, and it made me very sentimental. I never want him to get old on me.
True, and the good thing is that when the kids grow, they provide moral support to parents.	Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it.
Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!	I love a good surprise like anyone else; however, when my girlfriend waited until 8 pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present, I was caught off guard. I thought she had forgot.
Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!	She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.
Is he a stay at home father, or does he just not want to work?	I work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day, Not Fair!
I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.	He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.
Must of been pretty surprised, Also great to have friends like that.	So the other day was my 23rd Birthday! I had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room, a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off, and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! It was such a shock, and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience!
That must of just made everything even better!	It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake, chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery!
That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.	I'm thrilled. I got a raise!
You are very lucky	Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.
No I haven't actually, I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though.	"Have you seen the film ""within"" on netflix? The other night my boyfriend and i watched it and I had trouble sleeping afterwards, it was pretty creepy!"
I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time, but if I do I will definitely check it out!	"Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out ""within""!"
Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?	I spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat
Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.	Very! It was a dark maroon stain.
Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations, which of course only makes it worse!	My wife is angry and I don't know what to say. My anniversary was yesterday and I had no clue!
"What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing ""your"" song?"	I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance.
You should not be so insecure like that.	So the other night my boyfriend and I were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm I coudn't help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away.
What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?	Its not about insecurity!
yes, several times.The place is magical.	Have you ever been to Las Vegas?
Well, you are about to have the fun of your life, but gamble responsible.	I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!
Why. Did you started dating recently or something	I was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night, it had left me in absolute shock. I did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose.
The most important thing is what you want.	No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!
Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?	I'm one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach. I ride giants.
Are you still competing on a professional level?	Yes, you can google me.
NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously, I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!	I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger.
Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?	It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.
Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!	A bowl of dry cereal.
I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!	Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.
I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?	Have you ever participated in any races, half or full marathons?
That's great for her.	I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon, it was inspirational!
hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?	I am not afraid to admit this: I am 32 and afraid of the dark. The other day, my electricity went out due to a storm. It was dark, I couldn't find my phone or a light, so I screamed for my girlfriend to wake up. Am I embarrassed to say that, not at all, lol
OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?	I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is, I don't even believe in the supernatural, so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it, I think.
That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?	Before I applied at Inline I really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in.
Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!	I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..
I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?	My husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state I felt really lost and alone for a bit.
Maybe one day if you have the time, you can pay him a surprise visit.	Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.
That is good. Where you running late	I made it on time to the bus stop.
That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind	I was running late and so did the bus.
I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!	So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad.
I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.	Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.
Sounds like a good idea.	I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.
Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do!	I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however, that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water.
That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.	Yes! I start swimming lessons next week. I have went 32 years without knowing how to swim, and that one visit changed all that.
Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.	Oh today I heard one of Nannie's favorite songs on the radio.  It made me really miss our car rides together.
I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her, that way she'll always be there in some form.	She was a lovely lady indeed!  I miss our time together a lot especially when I hear the music she used to listen to.
Yes, I love to visit the zoo!	Do you go visit some place that makes you miss growing up?
What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?	I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.
That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.	My mother was always there for me when I was sick, annoyed and sad
My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.	Well my dad too but my mum was so much more, even when I was naughty she was still there.
That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?	When I was little I got chased by a large dog and now that I'm much older the feeling is still the same.
You need to fight your fear	I am, everytime I see a dog, I begin to run the other direction instantly
wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!	I actually have no friends, can you believe that? I'm ok with it though.
Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family	No, it's not sad. I really like to be alone, as i'm an introvert. I need my space.
Yes I do actually, I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once.	Do you ever find it hard to see at night when it's raining?
I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened.	That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.
Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!	I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving, an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind
I bet, losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!	I was, it saved me a lot of problems
Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied.	I written down my notes on a double sided A4 paper, now I just have to wait for the exam which will begin in the next 5 minutes.
Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released!	Oh I did, I have been doing it for weeks!
Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!	An employee who had not been working as long as me received a promotion
I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.	I definitely did not feel appreciated
That is hilarious. I bet.	When that happened to me, even the teacher couldn't stop herself from laughing.
Oh my just the opposite LOL	I was so awkward and quiet in school, how about yourself?
Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.	I can't wait to December when my first born arrives into the world. I'm going to make sure they have a great life.
I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent!	Thanks I'm stressed, excited and hopeful for the future. Do you have kids?
wow yes it is	I was just speaking with my buddy. He is very over wight and somehow finished a marathon last weekend. Impressive!
He probably stored that up for his energy for the race	I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.
Haha oh wow, how was that for them	My friend stayed awake for 36 hours studying for the MCAT!
Thats great, im glad she did well	she did well actually, i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!
I hate it when that happens! were you ok?	I was commuting to work and a driver cut me off
I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.	I made it out ok, just so irritating
That sounds nice! DId you have fun	I was busy due to work and visited my family for the first time in awhile
I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, it is important to make time for family.	It was great, felt refreshing to be around them
I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that	I get so annoyed with people who say one thing and do something else. My boss is one of those people. I wish there was just instance that I could be like this is where he annoyed me, but that isn't the case. It happens every day.
Sounds like the best thing to do honestly	Yeah, it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around.
you will survive, and you have something to look forward to	I have an 8 hour shift in the office today but i can't wait to go home to see my boyfriend!
i hope your work day goes by fast	exactly, it's keeping me going since i'm not feeling to good today!
Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.	When I was 12, I got ran over by a truck. I was with my older cousin and his car messed up. Since he was my hero, I listened to everything he said, so when he told me to get the truck rolling and jump in. I listened. however, my 12 year old legs didn't make it and got trapped under the truck
I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?	"Well, he was 17 at the time, so in his defense, he just was being a ""dumb teenager"". My parents never let me go with him again after that though. "
Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?	I only got a B- on an assignment i worked really hard on recently, but i'm working even harder now studying to ace the exam!
Congratulations! Studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?	I do actually!
Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!	I was inspecting rooms yesterday when I bent down to look under a bed, I felt the back of my pants tear. The hole was the entire back of my pants.
Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!	Yes, I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole.
Oh that sounds so scary!	I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car.
I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.	It was very scary, i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?
Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted	So as I've gotten older over the last 10 years. I gained 30 pounds. My wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed I have a bowl of ice cream.
Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.	yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.
Yes, I have an Associate's in Nursing.	Did you ever attend college? I just completed my bachelor's degree and I'm feeling really good about my future!
Yes, it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!	Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others!
Holy smokes! Let me guess, better for the environment?	Have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? Because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want's us to use feels like.
You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet, but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!	yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.
But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!	I scored a 95 on my promotion exam, I was upset that I missed one question.
Oh, it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)	Thank you, I am definitely proud! When was your last exam?
I love the Autobahn.	On the way from work I hit 155 in my VW on the Autobahn. I was well impressed with the car.
Yes I use to own an Audio.	I've been faster in my old Audi but this little car is a 4 cylinder and still super fast.
I have never done that, good job.	Last weekend I did something big. I finished my first 125 mile Iron man race. I'm still pumped.
You should. When is the next one.	That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again.
Oh wow thats cool.	Last night I was looking at my things I have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things. The good memories came flooding back.
Thats good you still think of him.	Yes, he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long.
Thats cool. Was it hard?	I went to a school for massage therapy, but I was worried at first that it would be strange to massage people I didn't know.
Wow that is a lot.	Some of it was. I had to learn the name, attachment point, and action of every muscle in the body. There are over 800.
What do you get from your mom?	I think I get it from my mom. She would never open the door for uninvited guests.
I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!	Being bothered by uninvited guests
I love dalmatians.	My first dog was a dalmatian. We adopted her and then went right to a soccer game before I even had time to play with her.
How old was she.	She was a great dog! That game felt so so long though. I had to watch her sitting with my parents while I played.
Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.	I have a friend who is always complaining. She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's.
Does she have like some other issues like mentally?	I didn't know her when she was young, so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable.
I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.	Have you ever put a pair of shoes on your feet that felt so sweet that made your sole happy?
That is the worse, you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst, happens to me all the time.	yea, I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!
So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had, or have you been unsuccessful?	Yes, I was angry and sad.
Wow, did they notice?	I was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh. I pee'ed my self. I felt like I wanted to die.
They will forget about it soon.	yep, to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder.
I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?	Becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery I became uneasy to shop there.
That's the worst! You think you can trust people, and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again.	They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.
That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?	I just found out my new insurance is going to cover my big dental surgery coming up. No more bad jibbers!
That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.	Yes, they are covering $4,500 worth of work. I only have to pay $100 total. I can't wait to have good teeth.
I love Colorado, my favorite state.	I have a solo trip coming up. I'm going to Colorado to climb Mt. Elbert Solo. It's the tallest mountain in the united states.
I wish I could live there.	Yes me two. I used to live in Colorado. I have not been up a mountain that big in years, I'm getting the belly butterfly's.
Did you fart?	Last weekend I was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner I got bad gas.
Did they smell?	It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time.
Did anyone get hurt?	We had a hail storm about a month ago. It ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it.
Thats good, as long as no one got hurt.	No, thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area.
No training at all!  Wow, that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?	My husband just ran a Marathon. He had no training I was blown away by him. True inspiration!
That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?	26.2 miles. He walks about 10 miles a day at work so that's some training sorta.
WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.	He wants to do an Iron Man. 126.2 miles, running, biking and swimming.
Wow you are brave.	I don't like saying this, and this is the first time I have but a few days ago I drove by my ex-wife and mine house, and for a few seconds it made me nostalgic.
I bet you drove fast.	Yes, it was only a fleeting moment but it was there.
Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it, I don't think.	I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little.
Have you ever done anything else so frightening?	Yea, until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.
I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me, I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!	Yes, I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it.
At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.	Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15?
Love, it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me.	Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?
yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.	Well congratulations for taking your time, look at it that way.
Hope so. I don't do well with heights.	Maybe try controlled breathing exercises, I'm sure you'll be fine and want to do it again.
Oh, I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?	I had a huge exam that like 25 percent of my grade. I study for 2 weeks for it
Well, at least you didn't go down in your grade. But, it wasn't right to treat the students like that!	Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in, so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade
That is good, how old are you?	As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress. It makes life easier when you think like this.
I am 31 so same generation.	33 so not super old or super young. Just happy with who I am.
Oh gosh, I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know?	Got a pizza last night. It gave me food poison. Now I'm stilling here sick and angry.
Wow! In that instance, I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food.	Yes, I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something.
and did you knock it out of the park?	I had studied for an exam for several days, so I was confident when I strolled into class because I knew I would ace it
Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's.	Uh, I made a B on it,  so it was a false sense of confidence, lol
Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.	When my son was 5 years old, he had to have his tonsils taken out. I thought it would be nothing, but when they went to take him back, I got so anxious.
That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.	Yeah, he was fine, but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't, but I did.
Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?	My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it.
I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.	We don't know them well, but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after, but some people have to get up for work.
it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.	My dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down. It was a very sad, but necessary decision.
She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.	It was very hard, but she was suffering. Our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon. He assured us that it was not.
Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?	My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit.
Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?	About seven months. Too long.
That's awesome! What did they talk about?	We had a really great guest speaker at work today.
Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?	He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's.
Sounds like it was very exciting!	I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.
Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.	I am a bit Breaking Bad fan and love Better Call Saul. Season 4 starts in August.
I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.	I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting.
I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?	I came home today and someone had eaten my leftovers. I was so irritated!
I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!	Yes, it was my partner. He owes me big time
It happens to everyone, are you out of it now?	I got into some serious financial troubles a few years back.
Oh well, it was nice to have someone to help you.	yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.
I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily	Do you like fair rides? I can't take them myself.
Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.	Yes, I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.
yeah, and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them	I just don't think they're safe enough, many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.
I bet you were, I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.	Two years ago, I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it, i was angry and hurt.
I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.	I know it was a horrible experience at the time, now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up
Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them	I wish I could go back to the 80's for a little while at times.
Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them	That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?
Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life	Do you have a favorite era?
Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed	Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think.
So if not by studying ,what else?	I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college.
That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital?	I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time!
You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.	No, I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal, but it healed.
That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!	Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core.
Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!	My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.
Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?	I can't believe my husband planned this all by himself! My mind is still blown by this!
When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?	We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings, but mostly excited!
That's too funny. You know, I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!	Don't you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can't? Well, that happened to me recently. I was going to give away some of my son's old toys, but started looking at then and realized that I need to keep them for no other reason than that I was being sentimental
Yes, someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling	I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol
I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?	I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago, and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago
That's sweet, I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!	Yes, we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town, so it allowed me to get really close with her.
Wow, that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?	I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday, when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics.
That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!	They couldn't capture him, he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.
What was the initial talk?	Yes, I was surprise on how he changed to another talk
So how do you feel when lonely?	I should descript how I could feel when am lonely
Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.	It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!
yes, i understood the first time.	It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!
I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt,	I slipped on a puddle in the mall once. I was so embarrassed that I pretended I was hurt badly.
Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.	Even animals get embarrassed, I've seen it in my cats.
Oh dang, talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol	Yes, my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.
That is a hilarious intro, thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things, you have nothing to worry about ;-))	One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened
These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov, you crazy kids!	"Well, I most def want to be insightful and intelligent, so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about, but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing ""Along Came Polly"" sceneros in your head. "
Is that good or bad? Why the concern?	Lately, my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls,i don't even want to think of i
OK why do you think so?	I think it is bad
Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem	It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can.
I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another, we would not have much problem	It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.
Well you should try to study more and see what happens	My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test.
Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf	I did, I can't remember, I either made an A or a B in there.
THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.	Well, this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever, but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago, I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me, and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks, in the middle of the road, jumped out, and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short, I saw my own reflection in the mirror.
That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?	It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it, lol
Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared, especially during storms.	I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted, I am 32 now, lol
I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :)	Why no response?
You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?	Is my response not good enough?
Really?  Where do you live at?	It is really hot here most of the year.
I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando, Florida.  So Im in the same boat.	Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks.
That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???	Ok I was in Walmart buying a video game when this dud eshows up and immediately questions my selection. Like it's some kind of internet forum!
I would be scared of a guy like that.	"I dunno, but I just said ""That's great, bro"" and left.  Then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it."
Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most?	This was several years back. I was single, but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie, so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong! Horrible mistake. It was a tear jerker, and I had no one there to see it and be like awe. All those tears wasted for nothing! lol
Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..	Oh, it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory, and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him. At the time, I was like I want that; however, now that I am in a relationship, I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well
You mean nostalgic?	I was joyful because my grandad shared the gospel with me when I was 11.
What your grand father did to you was very special.	I guess I am nostalgic now.
That is not very considerate or respectful, plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.	Can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street?
I live in the country, so I do not have neighbors that live close.	That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors?
I sometimes get freaked out, but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors.	How fortunate, my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories.
Yes. Peace is key.	That's true. You can live in peace.
Uhmmnn! Cut down on the intake	I regret drinking way too much soda. Now my teeth look bad.
You need to see a dentist then	I quit. Probably going to need some fillings.
Just all the time.Who does not?	Have you ever felt really annoyed at yourself?
It depends on the machine you are working on.	Yeah right now I dont know how to make a game install on another drive. Do you?
Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?	This is a silly story, but it reminds me how confident teenagers can be. When I got my first tattoo, for some reason, it gave me this false sense of confidence. I am not sure why other than at the time I thought my tribal tattoo was something to admire
That was bad. You can try some tattoo removal tool	I got it when I was 18. I didn't take care of it, so now it looks like a shady prison tattoo, lol
Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.	A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink, but I didnt have any cash, so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something
I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it.	A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink, but I didnt have any cash, so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something
Sorry! Try harder next time!	I never expected to fail my final exams,that is a major blow for me.
Never late you know!	Yeah, i know,i ought to have taken my studies seriously.
That sucks. Are they mad or what?	Am surprised there is no response from my friend.
It's kinda annoying to me when people don't call you back.	Sucks? I don't know about sucks.
Serious? Why are you scared when you are in a wreck?	I was scared when I was in a wreck.
Wow, you really have to be careful dear.	I was on an overpass and didn't want to fall off.
Yes I have, it feels really bad when it happens.	Have you ever felt really ashamed?
Yea it can be quite embarrassing to look back on.	Yeah same. Sometimes I can make a fool of myself by trying to act too smart or something like that.
Come on, you do not have to be jealous of your brother	My younger brother always get the best dates and beautiful girls to date,i hate it.
You can learnt some skills from your brother. Maybe it will help	I can't handle that very well. I need to get my groove and swag on. Damn it!
Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies	It's high time i get my self a girlfriend,i feel so bored up
That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always	Yeah, i'm so ready to date.I want to meet my person.
Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class.	I really feel like depressed sometimes when I realize how bad my tech skills are.
There's ton's online, and knowing more about computers can really help any profession.	That's true. There's a lot of stuff online. No I'm completing college for a natural sciences degree lol.
I am sure it is something disgusting. Do you have someone do it around you	I don't like it when people talk with their mouth full of food
You can just let him know you are not comfortable with it	Yeah, i close friend of mine likes doing that. she has to stop.
yes the patient is very ill	I saw an article of someone I went to high school with who was working with an Ebola patient?
oh that is really a bad news i heared	It was cool cause her dad died of cancer, so now she is helping sick people.
What is it that you would like to share with me? I am very interested to hear about it!	hi
Whoa, I hope you win! You never know, it could be your lucky day!	I am excited I bought a lottery ticket today and the jackpot is over 20 million
I know how you feel, I get so scared when exams come up, its so hard sometimes	I have never been ready like this for an exam in my entire life.
Yea open book make you think you dont need to study but that isnt true at all	Open book exams can be tricky, i have no option but to pass this exam.
Hi	hi there
Cool, I could not do English.	i just got my bachelors degree in english with a gap of 3.5
yea that does seem like a lot of work could you ever handle it?	I was impressed because my boss has 2000 investment clients. That seems like so much work.
ooo well that explains a lot. well hopefully he will pass some to you	Maybe. Some of them he got from a guy who retired though.
Which work are you talking about. it is always a good feeling to get things done. There a way your brain reward you with good feeling	I felt really elated to be getting work done. It's hard sometimes and  I pulled through. The happiness is real too!
Oh yes, i do most times. Who does not	It was just some stuff for a new job. Do you feel happy to complete stuff?
I say think of all the places you always wanted to go and then choose a place you never even considered.	I am trying to decide where I should go next on vacation, I love travelling.
Yes deals will allow you to travel more for sure.	That is interesting but I usually look for deals so I can go to more places
Do you think you can win the lottery	today i saw the lottery was for 36 million at the gas station so I decided to buy a ticket.
Then why do you want to risk your money on such thing. Why not buy yourself a nice shoe instead	hahaha no I don't at all but I was just really hoping that it would happen on the off chance.
I am very glad to hear that. Do you have any children?	I'm happy with where i am with life right now. Work is great, family is good and business is booming.
I have no kids, but would love to have some at some point!	I have three beautiful kids and you?
yes i do	Do you feel hopeful ever? I feel hopeful that I'm gonna get in shape.
i feel hopeful that i am going to recover from a mental dosirder	What do you feel hopeful about?
That sounds terrible. Why didn't he come?	i remember inviting my brother but he did not turn up for the party. i felt so lonely and discriminated.
Ah I see. I don't really talk to my brother much.	he said he was held up at work and coud not make it
That seems pleasant. I am currently in my chair working!	I am relaxed right now ate a nice dinner now I am relaxing on the couch watching tv.
I need some good rest, myself. Sleep is so important!	I am getting ready to go to bed I am in my pyjamas
Awesome!  Thats exciting.  What college are you applying at?	hey i just applied for my top college today and i'm hoping to get the letter soon to see if I get accepted.
Thats awesome!  I wish you the best of luck in your future studies!	i'm applying to my local college its called samford
What is so interesting about the series	I want to see the Halo TV series when it comes out. Spielberg is supposed to direct it.
I see. Are you excited about seeing the movie	Probably mostly the super heroes in it.
congratulations on getting your job we should go celebrate !	I am happy I didn't work in over a year it was hard to get a job but I finally got one, thanks to a friend
as long as the cake is funfetti i am more than there	Oh yes we should let's go have some cake and ice cream.
Wow, are they going to pay for it?	my parents want to get me a brand new camaro !
You have some very nice parents, when I graduated my parents said pay us more rent now.	yea they are they said since I graduated top of my class that they are going to cover it !
Thats a really good idea, that sounds like it would be hard to sleep though	I went to bed early the night before my surgery. I wanted make sure I wasn't late to the appointment.
Im glad it turned out well or i hope so.	Yes, surgery is so scary. But i'm glad it's over.
As it should.  However those things happen to everyone it is a part of life.	The thought of loosing a beloved one scares me
Hopefully something better happens when we die and our lives will go on in a better way.	As sad as it may sound,that is the reality which we cant escape.
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Was it a wedding?	the event was all white from dressing to the decorations. I really loved it
That's wonderful. I am going to a wedding next week!	it was a wedding shower
I understand. I remember when we had to save games to 5 inch floppy disks. They made really strange shuffling sounds and a lot of times didn't even read.	I felt pretty frustrated at some tech problems I had earlier. I couldn't find a way to download a game to a different drive.
Yeah, I had my Commodore 64 and Amiga in the late 80's. Still, the games were great when they worked!	Those are old from what I understand. This was a while ago?
How wonderful. What sort of dog?	me and my kids picked  up our new puppy the other day !
A fluffy white one? How amazing!	it is a west highland terrier and he is so cute !
How old is he?	yea a fluffy white one and the kids love him
That sounds amazing! What do you think you're gonna do there?	I am so excited my friend told me last minute we are going to Las Vegas for my birthday she arranged everything.
I've been one time but I was too young to drink or gamble so it was a little boring. That sounds like a great time though, I'm happy for you!	Go shopping and eat, I love food and Vegas has some amazing food.
That's unfortunate. Some people just cannot help but act rude.	i was disgusted at the way the man was staring at me non-stop
That's unfortunate. What do you think about Uber?	yes, and i ended up getting a different taxi, i lost my money
That is a tough thing to deal with but hopefully his first F will also be his last.	my son brought home his first F today.
Fornite has surely caused many kids grades to drop.	yea he is a smart kid I just think he has been playing too much fortnite.
That was so bad. What kill the diver	I was glad to see the boys get out of the cave, but sad that a diver died.
It means he miscalculated the time he was to spend under the water. Sorry for him	They said he ran out of oxygen, while uderwater. That was weird since it happened after they located the team.
Why did u leave your luggage for a stranger	Yesterday i left my luggage behind for a stranger to look after it
Wao,its a mistake,	That was so naive on my part, i had to leave shortly to buy a drink from the shop.
That's intense. I hope you do as well as possible!	I am very stressed I have to take a major final exam on saturday.
Keep up the great work. Pass that exam with flying colors.	Thank you me too I have been studying like crazy.
Yeah, sometimes I want to just stop going to work. I hate TPS reports so much!	Do you ever feel overwhelmed by assignments or work?
Yeah, Bill Lumbergh is the worst boss ever. He kept calling me every day when I just wanted to sleep instead of work!	Like the ones from Office space? haha
i love cats, just hold it between your arms, it will be okay	so i am trying to type fast right now and my cat keeps moving on my lap.
thats better, but sorry for the disappointment she had caused	yea she finally decided to settle down so i think I can type good now.
wow that is amazing I went there back in 2000. You are in for a big treat. Make sure to get french bread.	i am excited am goint on vacation next month to Paris. I have been waiting for this period and cant wait to be there
Also the mcdonald's taste way better there than in the US if your looking for good cheap food.	yah, french bread is on my list, will definitely do it
You need to be patient. Getting promoted at your work place takes patience and perseverance	I started a new job a few weeks ago I want to get promoted quickly
Your hopes are high. It means you have a good chance of getting it. And i hope you have the requirement too?	I have a good chance though it is a very small department
Wow! It looks great that you feel achieved	I'm so happy with all my achievements i have made in life.
Congrats Doctor!! your parents would have been proud of you	The most outstanding achievement is when i was able to graduate with my Doctoral degree by the age of 30 years.
Sorry to hear that you did not get approved.	My dream car is a Hyundai Genesis, but I didn't get approved for financing unfortunately.
You are right about that. Owning a car can get expensive.	It's ok, a car is another bill for me anyway. I'll keep taking Lyft.
My dream car is a Chevy Camaro.	What's your dream car?
Classic 1975 would be great.	That's a nice retro car, which year?
Do you still have them?	I had a couple rabbits once, interesting pets to take care of.
Do you own any other pets now?	No, this was as a kid. The dog essentially killed one. Then the other one became more grumpy.
Wow.  Did you get hurt?  Sounds scary.	So I was driving on the interstate and another car ran into the back of me.
I am always scared about those airbags!  I am so glad you are ok!	No just the airbags went off and I hit my head and got a few bruises.
Oh my goodness, that's horrible. Who was she?	she gotan accident and by the time she was reached in hospital, the doctors pronounced her dead
That's horrible, I hope you are okay and are recovering from that.	she was my cousin
No,i don't feel surprise d	Do you ever feel surprised at your abilities?
Yes,i am	You must be very talented then?
I'm glad too. What made it swell up anyway?	I am glad cause some antibiotics fixed my swollen gum.
Oh I get that, I had that happen near one of my wisdom teeth too.	Maybe not cleaning teeth properly, it was around a wisdom teeth that needs to come out or some work.
Wow, it was because you were young, that is why	I stole a pair of shoes once, I feel so bad about it. I was young and poor and needed shoes for work.
It is really nothing, children behave like that sometimes	Back then, I felt like the world owed me something because of my bad childhood.
What did you pass?	But finally, it happened that I passed
That's great! I bet you feel relieved.	My university result, when in school
i am so happy for you. I know how it feel when you are stranded	this lady has just popped in when i needed help most. I had forgoten my wallet at home and needed to refil my gas. she offered to help
You can collect her contact and make friend with her	yes. i was so relieved, thanks to her
I didn't understand you	4
That is bad. How could you forget?	I feel extremely terrible i did not invite my best friend to my wedding
I only have a couple really good friends who are always there for me. The rest of my friends don't really care about me that much.	Do you think your friends are looking out for you?
Yeah, we have to watch out for ourselves. At least we won't let us down, lol.	I feel the same way. Maybe it's normal?
That's great news to hear. I hope things continue to stay great for you.	I expected something good, that was why things are working well for me now
I agree. I think that difficult times are best navigated with a calm mind.	Of course, it is good not to lose yourself when things are difficult
I hope it doesn't rain. Where are you going?	I can't wait to enjoy my vacation, pending it doesn't rain the whole time.
That's great. I have been there before. It used to be a Spring Break hotspot.	Panama City Beach, FL. I am really looking forward to the beach and resting in my suite.
Oh no! That's not very nice but I guess you can play it off by just acting cool and laughing it off.	we were in class and i had not enough sleep the previous night because i had gone to a party. i slept on my desk and later found on my facebook wall a video of me sleeping while the students laughed at me.
It's okay it's pretty funny, and it'll be forgotten about so quick anyhow. I know how it feels haha, we all do.	i did but i feel so embarrassed
Oh ,really,that's so brave of him	I was surprised my brother signed up for the army.
Ok,where did he travel to?	Yeah, it might have just been an ROTC thing, but he did some traveling.
Yikes!  Schools get really mad about that, as well as it makes the kid worry.	Back when I worked two jobs and went to school full-time, I overslept and was late to get my child from school..
Don't beat yourself up.  It happens all the time.  I am sure you are a loving parent!	Yes, she was crying and it made me cry. I felt so irresponsible.
That is awful. Was anyone else hurt?	it was foggy and slippery and the driver could not control the brakes. he suddenly run over a child but she survived the injuries
Were there any signs that the driver might have been impared, as opposed to the breaks malfunctioning?	no, just the child, she was trying to cross the road with her dog
I hope the child recovers from her injuries.	no, the driver was okay, the problem was with the breaks
Oh wow, how did you feel about that?	One time somebody ran into our brick mailbox with their car and knocked a few bricks off.
How fast were they going?	I wasn't sure how it could have happened given how fast they would have been going.
Oh how nice, how long are you staying?	I can't wait for tomorrow,we are going to Barbados for vacation as a family.
That sounds exciting I hope you have a lot of fun!	Just for a week.
That's refreshing to hear, I'm happy for you. I rarely hear that people are satisfied with their partner.	He is my boyfriend, very good guy
Wow, what really happened?	I think I should have listed my place on Airbnb before leaving the country.
Oh really, that was hectic for you I guess	I ended up paying rent and bills ahead 2 months instead.
You need to calm down and focus so that you can pass the exam	am so anxious about the exam and i feel like i am not ready for it
Do you get enough sleep. Being sleep deprived can make you lose focus	I am trying to

oh nice well happy birthday	Nooo, I'm  not  pregnant, was just expecting my birthday gifts
Were you up when he got home?	I'm so mad my son came home late last night
I can understand your position. How old is he?	I was right at the door waiting for him,never been that scared.
Is she a model?	I was happy for her because that was her first sitting
"Oh, so what does a ""sitting"" entail?"	No, she is a medical student, always wanted to be a doctor
Who are you talking about? What happened?	But we waited and waited, she didn't still show up
That is bad. I hope you see her in another event.	Went for a music concert in New York and was expecting to see Beyonce but she didn't show up
Yea I know that feel, outside of a few people I knew nearly know one and avoided lots of people cause no one cared	I had no friends while in high school and was really miserable.
It can be really frustrating, seems like so many people have it good while so many have the short end of the stick	Yes, and now that I've added them on Facebook, they still don't interact with me.
Yeah,but very few.	Do you have faithful friends?
Most of my friend have had in the past just wanted to benefit from our relationship,it was not genuine.	Why is that the case?
That's great. I'm trying to get a girlfriend right now :/	I have never cheated on my girlfriend not even once
Yeah they are. It makes me sad too man.	I wish you luck buddy, most of these girls out here are so fake.
Did you get a car as a gift? That's exciting.	i was really excited upon seeing the present because the car was so adorable
That is so nice of her! That's really really generous.	yes, my mom bought for me as agift
I think there must be a reason for that	Some girls can just breakup with you for no reason
Oh,thats life,so sorry for that	I tried to ask but she refused to say anything. I guess she got a better guy
What makes you say that?	I have such a big heart, i love my people.
Do you have  a large network of friends and family?	I like making people around me happy.
Somewhat, ive felt better these past couple months than i usually have	Do you feel content with your life right now?

A lot of the time. I'm quite an easily frightened person! Especially by large animals!	Do you ever feel afraid?
Have you always had a fear of falling?	Yeah. I'm more scared of failing I guess

I was supporting England too,	I didn't like it,my team  lost during yesterdays match between England and Croatia
Who do you think will win the cup	So bad, let wait for the finals.

Just anywhere like when leaving a friends place or taking stuff on a trip, i somehow manage to forget one small thing occasionally	For where? I did not, I was fully ready
What steps have you taken to remedy the situation and make her feel safe?	we were arguing about her taking my car without my knowledge and i ended abusing her. i feel bad
I think that's for the best. Abuse is never okay.	i apologized to her but still she wount talk to me
Im sorry im not sure i follow.	I just wanted to face anyone to a fight Cox they were just so annoying
Oh I see, i can imagine that can get really frustrating	My neighbors were really annoying to an extent, so I was ready to face anyone that will be annoying again
How did that make you feel?	Oh yeah, I kept it to iron it, for me to come out and see her on my beautiful dress
Oh no,trust me if it were me,she would hear me good!	I felt so annoyed and devastated, because I was already late for the date
Wow, but to have children in the house is good	The thought of having a third child in our family is overwhelming
Oh yes...children are blessings, I love them being around me	Every time we add another child it feels great.

Oh about what exactly? Are you talking about family or friend or SO?	I lied because, had it been I told  her first, she wouldn't have agreed
Ah ok, was it fun then?	I went out with my friends
Oh yeah, I've been through quite a few sad things before. What about you?	Do you ever feel sad about anything?
Definitely, the sad is needed to balance out the good.	Yeah some. It's a part of life I guess.
I figure we'll all be there at some point once we get old.	i am afraid of hospitals since my cousing was admitted due to injuries in a road accident. I saw alot of blood and sick people and the thought of going there scares me.
My parents worked in them, so I am used to them.	i dont want to imagine
oooh, sorry about that, what happened	My cat disappeared, we figure it died.
sorry, i hope you areokay now	I was the last person to look after it when people were on vacation for about a week. I feel bad cause for a couple of those days I didn't crack the garage door.
Where you the only one in the house?	The house was so quiet, and if I talk, it will echo
Wow, that's nice!	Oh yes, I would have gone out with my best Friend but she went on a holiday
Wow, that's a big mess-up! How did that turn out?	I had an important high school race. And I left my shoes at home.

Who bought you this golden watch? Was it a wizard?	That he bought me a watch, not just a watch but gold
Oh? Is it more of art than purpose in its form?	One time at work I put together a shelf that had nonmatching parts.
Oh, I see. A workable shelf then.	It's more like there were leftover parts and we made do with what we had.
Hahaha hope you did very well	It was a happy moment that day I checked my result, I was so afraid but later it varnished
That's good....  I did well too	Of course, very excellent result
So, did you get it?	I was very expectant of money last week
That is cool. Definitely you will	Noo, but hopefully I will get it this week
Wow, and you didn't get pulled over?	One time I was driving my car at it's maximum speed potential because I was late for a meeting.
Must've been some important meeting!	No, I had not tried to max it out. But at 95 it pretty much shook and wouldn't go faster.
I don't know what flogging is.	I was flogged very well that day
"Looking up the definition tells me its punishment by being whipped or beaten, so unless you mean you were beaten metaphorically, you shouldn't be ""wowing"" me."	Wow, I mean I was disciplined
Well done, what type of performance was it?	I was amazed with the good performance I put up on stage yesterday
Was it a ballet. I enjoy watching dance performances.	Dance performance

amazing! Thats really nice	By helping me with my chores, even without me asking
What do u want to eat?	I was really hungry and ready to eat
Ok,have u prepared it?	Noodles I guess
normal is the best way, it helps the mother bond with the child	She was told that she will give birth through CS, but she delivered normal
we are adamant to have our baby born normal. I have seen first hand the CS mothers and their closeness (lack of) with their kids	Exactly, and it helps the woman heal fast.
You think so?	So many relationships are being spoilt by cheating and  unfaithfulness
Well, I've kept quite a few relationships throughout my life. If I actually wanted to look at online profiles, I do it mostly for research or investigative purposes. Other than that, I'm only interested in online chat.	Yeah Cox I've been in that situation before
Why, what do you have planned?	I needed money this weekend
Sounds like fun!  I hope you find the money to do it.	Wanted to go see a movie with my girlfriend
Great! you must be well prepared. Are you nervous?	I got a job interview for a very prestigious company.  I spent weeks studying and researching them then had my interview this morning.
Yes it sounds like you did everything right.  I hope you hear back from them soon about a job offer.	No actually I was feeling very positive as I had done so much research.  During the interview I was able to answer the questions with ease and my courage just grew and grew.  I left feeling on top of the world as it had gone so well!
did you get what you needed?	I needed money last week and was very expectant of money
well that's better than nothing at all :)	Nooo but I got a little
Oh no, I've had a few days like that. Did you laugh it off?	i had the worst day ever yesterday.  I started early and was half asleep getting ready.  I just grabbed to pumps and put them on my feet but when I got to work my male colleague pointed out that I had infact put two odd shoes on!!
Well good on you for toughing it out. Your the stronger for it.	Not really I was just mortified!! One shoe was plain black and the other had a pink bow on it at the front.  I had to walk about all day while the whole office couldnt stop laughing.  I think by the end of the day though I tried to see the funny side.
what kin of food was it?	That food was my last hope, I was so hungry that day
I love pasta	Pasta food. I felt bad

Hello friend! May I ask what it that you feel that way about?	Yes, because that's how I feel about it.
I don't understand what you are talking about. Are you feeling okay today?	It encourage to be impressed.
of course, like they say happiness is contagious, if you are happy everything around you stays happy and it will be hard to die young	You need to be happy for you to live longer
Also your home stays blessed because you become a more better partner	Yeah for sure, that's why I always like to be happy
Wow that must be lot of preparation	My roommate and I used to plan for weeks to prepare for music festivals!
Where is this event going to be	It was, but part of the fun was getting ready!  Sometimes the planning can be just as fun as the event!
That's amazing. It's good to give your head a rest so that you will recall all the items easily when you are at the exam center	I have done all my paper work for my exam tomorrow, now i can relax until tomorrow.
I wish you all the best in the Exam	Thanks, I think I have learnt everything because redid each past exam paper 10 times.
Thats good, I am not sure if I can ask what happened?	I recently got great news, medically.
Oh wow, I am glad that you are okay.	I'm glad you did!  I had a tumor removed, and it was NOT cancerous!
Omg I would have ran faster than forest gump... what did you do?	The other night I went outside to unplug the pool pump and saw a snake. We have poisonous snakes around us so I was a bit worried when I saw it.
Im glad no one was hurt!	I ran inside and got my husband out of bed. He killed it since we have little kids we didn't want to take a risk that it was poisonous.
Oh no, I'm sure that was a hard memory to have brought up for you.	I was on facebook and my memories popped up reminding me that I lost my dog to bone cancer three years ago.
What was her name? Have you read Rainbow Bridge?	It was, she was a very special dog. One of the old souls with a heart of gold. I still miss her.
What a beautiful name! Hopefully your memories are more happy than sad now.	Yes, It is a beautiful poem! Her name was Skyber.
That's great. Teachers are so important.	I am so happy I was able to pass my teacher certification test and become an English teacher.
I wanted to become a teacher before. I was afraid of how hard it would be.	It's such a fulfilling job. The test was difficult, but I spent a lot of my free time studying for it.
Well congratulations! I hope your students appreciate you as much as they should.	It's a lot of work, but if you really put in the effort, it becomes much easier.
Oh my goodness, did you go to check what the noise was?	I was in a back room in our house and everyone else was asleep. I heard a weird crinkling noise and was worried that someone had come in the house.
I'm glad it wasn't anything serious! It's scary how quick our mind goes to the worst possible scenarios.	I did, it turned out to be my cat playing with a play mat the kids left out.
That's really cool of them. You weren't expecting it at all, hu?	When I turned 25 I got my first surprise party thanks to my parents.
Parents can be great sometimes. Did you have a good time?	No. I just thought we were going to an early dinner together.
What did you find?	i found some old keepsakes in my parents basement and it made me feel nostalgic
I love old school video games. What were your favorites?	old toys, sports equipment, video games etc
Congratulations. Interviews can be stressful	For my current job, I thought about interview answers that I did poorly on before. I was able to ace this interview and have been there for three years!
Thats smart. And it worked.	True. The interview I had before I got this job went so, so badly. I studied some common questions so I was ready the next time.
Nice. What is his name?	My puppy is turning 2 years old next month. The day I adopted her was one of the best days of my life.
Nice. I like dogs.	Churro. He's a boxer mix.
Oh my that sounds so scary! Was everyone ok?	I went zip-lining in Thailand once. A nearby tree fell and part of it hit the platform we were on.
Do you think you will ever zip line again?	We were all fine. A bit shaken up, but nobody got hurt thank goodness.
oh no. What do you do for that?	My son experienced stranger anxiety and didn't want to be out in public.
Oh. How old is he?	We had to leave the restaurant before everyone could order drinks.
Well, I hope you are feeling better. What makes you so nervous? Are you worried your superiors will look down on you leaving early?	Today as soon as I got to work I got sick. I have a new coworker that stepped in and helped me out. Her works looks good but I'm nervous.
I'm sure you can get in tomorrow and see how it looks. You can work together to make sure it works!	No we are allowed to help each other but I'm worried his code will not pass once the program is done.
That is very cool! How much did it cost?	I just upgraded the turbo on my car. I wanted more power but currently my VW can beat a corvette in a race. So I'm happy
Wow, sounds nice! Was it hard to do the work?	I did all the work my self but the parts were around 4500 besides the price off the all work I've all ready done to it. I'm trying to build a grocery getter that I can take to the race track.
Dang, that really stinks. Why did they quit so quickly?	Hired 4 more people to join my crew at work last week. 2 all ready quit. I'm bummed.
Perhaps you should screen new employees better? Like give them a physical performance test?	The  work was to physically hard for them. But I still had big hopes for them.
I hope it's nice for you. Do you have any alternate plans?	We are supposed to do the amusement park, tomorrow but I think it may rain.
Well, that's always a problem for me too, but at least you've got another $1.25 now.	We do, but I think my friends want to do the amusement park as well as something else. I don't know if I have money for both.
I think that is wonderful, it's about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option.	Hello! I recently read an article about medical marijuana now being allowed in the united kingdom, What do you think about it?
No, but as Mark Twain once said, the law is an ass.	the way it ended up being legalized, IMO, was a complete disgrace, they confiscated some childs weed who was epileptic, and as a result - predictably - he immediately started having seizured without it. Like gee, well done on torturing the kid! Do you think it was right to confiscate it, even though it technically wasnt legal at the time?
I'm glad they made the right decision eventually though. It's about time!	what an excellent quote
The coolest race I saw was late at night on the highway out of town.	The coolest race I saw was a high school 3200 meter relay.
Yeah, it can be pretty dangerous, but I was young.	I am a bad driver, otherwise I might like it.
I'm sorry to hear that. How long did you have him?	My hamster Donatello just died.
I bet pets are amazing. They're hard to replace once they're a part of the family	I had him for two years. He was my best friend.
Oooh, that's rough. Did you make him mad?	I cant believe my brother snitched on me. He told my girlfriend I cheated on her.
Well, I hope you can work things out at least	No, he just doesn't understand the meaning of loyalty.
Flying has seemingly become terrible these days. What about your trip was so bad?	I didnt like flying abroad
That sounds frustrating and a little scary.  Did you eventually make it to your destination?	It was snowingh really bad and the plane had to land in SC instead of Chicago
That's too bad.  But better safe than sorry.	No, I decided to cancel and eventually went home next day.It was the best idea.
Not too much.  I used to fly a lot but not anymore.  I stick around home now mostly.	Yea that was the idea. Go back to safety zone. No place like home. Have you traveled much ?
Well, have you tried reliving that through the Pokemon app that you can interact with?	I miss beating my brother in the Pokemon card game everyday.
Yes, I can understand that.. Sometimes nothing compares.. Have you guys played recently?	No, I need the real thing it just doesn't feel the same.
I know how that feels. I bet it was boring and lonely.	My boyfriend had to go out of town for a few days and I was left alone in the apartment. I didn't have many friends here at the time.
Did you get out and do anything?	Yeah, it was. I didn't have much to do all that weekend and the apartment was quiet.
That really is a big change for you! Are you excited to have some more down time?	My son starts kindergarten next month. I don't know what I will do since I don't work.
Yeah, that feeling will change when you see him coming home with a huge smile on his face!	"I am but also not sure how I feel like him ""leaving the nest"". "
Was it a long flight? Or was there lots of turbulance?	I was flying to Alaska and it was a nervewracking flight.
Ah, I can't imagine being up in the air that long! Sounds like it was a boring flight too.	It was about 9 hours. A little bit of turbulance. I just have nothing to do on flights.
I guess that is one positive!	Well the sights outside were pretty
Did you study hard?	I studied all night and I still flunked my math test. I can't believe it!
No, you should keep studying.	Yes, it just baffles me. Maybe next time I shouldn't even study.
That stinks, it's never worth giving up though! What line of work do you prefer?	I really wanted a certain job and I did not get it
I can definitely believe that.. I hope something opens up for you soon!	Video work. It is very competitive.
What was so fun?	It was so fun!
Oh yeah!!! I love taking my dog too, she gets to get all that dang energy out before I bring her back to our little apartment!	Taking my dog to the dog park!
That sucks, I love dogs.	I really miss my dog who passed away.
Yes I am sure she it.	Me too. She is a better place now.
Wow.. That is horrific!  I'm so glad you're okay.. Was anyone else hurt?	The other day I lost control of my car and got in a huge wreck. My leg broke, but I knew I would walk again.
Awesome. I am so glad to hear that.. Always good to hear the stories were someone gets away!!	No, by the grace of god. He protects me at all times.
I agree with that! I just had the rain cancel my trip to the beach yesterday! Makes me so mad...	I hate when I make plans and the rain cancels them....
I mean I like the rain at certain times.. But not when I'm trying to do fun stuff outside!	Yeah, some people like the rain! I don't get how.....
That is such a brilliant idea, are you excited about it?	I'm planning to return to college for engineering which should be cool.
That's awesome, you'll thank yourself later down the road for making yourself do it!	Yeah, I have more years left.
Oh wow! I have heard of that happening to lots of people. Did they get arrested?	I caught somebody stealing a package from my front yard on surveillance.
Yes they do. It has gotten really bad around here with car thefts. It's no wonder are car insurance rates are so high.	Not yet. People these days just don't care. They steal anything they lay their eyes on!
Oh really? What'd ya get?	I just got back from buying a few groceries at the store.
Why did he do that?	Just stuff for dinner. At the checkout, a guy took my receipt!
Math is a tough subject. Good for you.	I studied really hard for my math test last week, so I knew I would ace it.
Being good at math will open lots of opportunities for you. Keep at it.	I know, I feel like I can solve math problems that even Einstein couldn't solve.
How exciting that you were able to do that. I hope it was fun.	We have taken many unplanned trips this summer that I didn't have money for. But I was able to pick up more work and pay for them.
It's funny how you need a vacation to recover from vacation.	It has been a fun summer! I am so tired though.
How'd it go	I had a major project and felt very ready to present it to everyone at the office
That's great. Do you present often?	It went well, I think I gained confidence by being so prepared
Oh no, what happened?	I was walking home late at night and noticed I was being followed
Glad you are safe!	I ended up running back to my place
Have you talked to her about it?	My girlfriend seems to be distant and talking to other guys
That doesn't sound too good. Has she been like this before?	Not yet, she's also been texting other guys as well I think
Was it fun? Interesting? Engaging?	I finished a team based project with some co-workers
Good! Team based projects can be very hit or miss depending on your team so I'm glad it worked out for you	Yeah, it was fun, and we did so well
Did she give you a reason?	My girlfriend broke up with me
Sorry to hear that, i hope you find somebody else in your life.	She fell out of love with me
Sorry to hear that.Did you lose money?	I left my wallet behind by accident
So, you never actually lost the wallet.	I left in the bathroom and was able to get it back
That sounds amazing! How did it go?	A friend threw a birthday party for me
That's amazing, I have only had one brithday party like that in my life.	It was a lot of fun, I had no idea he was planning it
What kind?	I found some old toys of mine
I use to have a G.I Joe.	Some action figures I had when I was younger, I felt pretty nostalgic
What were they sick from?	A friend of mine was sick
That was nice of you.	Flu, I went over and gave him some food and medicine
I'll bet you were surprised. Were you glad to see them?	A friend who I hadn't seen in awhile showed up at my door
Did you reconnect and promise to keep in touch?	I was very happy to see him, we ended up going out for drinks
Was she your girlfriend?	I met a girl I hadn't seen in some tme
That is great, did you have fun?	No, but we did end up going out on a date
Yeah, thats rough. I hate having to clean up mess that wasn't my fault.	I really hated it when my dog got into the trash. It spilled everywhere.
Yeah, that sounds annoying. Maybe try to scold the dog so they won't do it again?	Yeah, it was pretty gross. A lot of rotten food.
That sucks. What was his name?	I really miss my dog. We had to put her down.
Barney was the name of my hamster.	Barney. He was such a good boy.
I know that feeling. It's nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.	I was very anxious to start driving at 16.
It's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time, that would definitely get me nervous.	It really is. It's like I can't remember all the rules of the road.
My wife, LOVES taylor swift.	I cannot wait to see Taylor Swift in concert!
That is awesome, I went to high school with Brett Favre! Small world.	I actually went to high school with her. I cannot believe she is as famous as she is.
I am glad you love her, it must be a nice feeling	A female coworker came onto me at work the other day, but I refused her advances because I love my wife.
That is a good thing then	Yes, I just can't see myself being with another woman.
That wasn't smart.	I cant believe I got arrested for a DUI this weekend, I let myself down.
Why did you then?	I know I promised myself I wasn't going to drink anymore.
Dang.. my old roommate was an engineering student. He always told me how hard it was. What kind of engineering?	I feel good about my last semester. I think I'll do better in my engineering classes this fall.
Yeah, I think once you get in the field, you're set. The jobs seem to pay well. Good luck with that, you sound like you know what you're doing.	I'm doing mechanical, it's pretty hard but it's interesting. A career in the field would be awesome!
Oh, the bus? Yeah I bet that was a little embarrassing. Sorry to hear that. I take my car for granted. Maybe you will get one someday.	I hate taking the but, today I was late to my stop and got there just as it drove away....
Well, keep working at it. It's a process.	I drove my parents' old car for a little, and i definitely took that for granted until it broke down lol. I'm trying to save up, I hope I get one too.
Where has he been?	I can't wait until I see my golden retriever Blue this weekend!
Oh I bet you are excited then! He will be happy too!	I live away from my parents, he lives with them.
Is there a reason why you didn't tell your boss?	I saw a colleague stealing money at work. I wonder if I did the right thing by not telling my boss.
Is there a way you could report it anonymously?	I just didn't want to be labeled as a snitch, but now I'm having second thoughts.
Oh I do too! I like a nice sunny day.	I hate when it rains, especially for several days at a time.
It's been really rainy. My power just went out awhile ago.	How has the weather been where you are.
Yes it makes me pretty upset to be honest.	Oh no, does that happen a lot when it rains near you?
"My brother used to have a yo-yo! He did a trick called ""Around the world"" and also one called ""The cradle."" Know those?"	I remember when we used to compete with Yo-Yo's to see who could do the best tricks.
Oh yeah! I remember that! I wasn't good at doing any of them. I mostly just watched him. Good memories.	"Yes, my favorite was called ""Walk the dog""."
Oh man I would have terrified I hate being up so high. He sounds really brave!	Last week we were at an amusement park and I cant believe my little brother got on the roller coaster with us. He's usually afraid of heights.
Did he go on anymore after that?	I know, he usually never goes on dangerous rides.
Well he's young, so you can't really fault him.	My son got spaghetti all over himself at dinner at a restaurant one night.
That's good. You seem like a great parent.	I didn't really care too much. I had remembered to pack him an extra set of clothes though.
does it happen often in your part of the country?	I hate when it is storming it makes me so uncomfortable.
wow.  i can only imagine	Yes especially in the summer time storms are bad and hurricanes are at a high I hide under my covers lol.
Thats nuts.	I was using the toilet at Walmart yesterday and somebody walked in on me.
Did she scream?	Whats worse is that I was in the wrong restroom. It was the girls restroom. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could.
Did you get to? What happened?	I was finally going to get to see dolphins up close.
I have never been there! Sounds fun, but I don't support Sea World and the way they treat their animals.	I went to Sea World for the very first time. We got to feed the dolphins.
OH GOSH! I would burn the whole house down. i'm terrified of spiders and bugs	Last week there was a huge tarantula on my wall. I thought it was going to jump on me.
i would have a heart attack!	OMG me too! I hit it with a rolled up news paper and a bunch of baby spiders came out. I had a panic attack and stomped on them.
I know how you feel. Life is too short.	I will never forget the first time I felt old. I saw a video of grandparents playing with grandchildren and I realized it had been awhile since I did those things.
Yes, you do! Just keep living everyday like your last.	yes, I try to remind myself that I still have a lot to offer.
wow, I never did understand why people want to get drunk in the first place. I sure hope he wasn't hurt.	Yesterday we had a pool party. My brother got drunk and did a back flip off the roof and landed in the pool.
it does sound like an amzing feat	I wasn't mad at him. I just never knew he was that athletic.
ohh that's rough...did you talk to them about it	I got on social media yesterday and saw that my friends went to a party, but they didn't invite me.
do they give you any kind of value...or do they just ignore you / put you down 90% of the time?	No, sometimes I feel like they just don't understand me.
Is your relative okay now?	Awhile back I was taking a relative to get a heart cath. The surgeon sent for me to enter the operating room.
It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.	oh yes, thank you for asking. other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok. Kind of scary when I was sent for.
Congratulations to him! You must be proud.	I got teary eyed when I watched my little brother get his diploma at graduation.
He's very lucky to have you.	I am, every time he succeeds, I succeed. I love my big headed brother.
oh yeah what happened?	I was supposed to drive a friend to work
omg is he upset?	I forgot to pick him up as I overslept
So did you help him / her	A friend needed help moving
That's pretty nice of you	Yeah, he didn't know of anyone else to turn to for help so I gave him a hand
Wow, thats a nice car	Yesterday my friend bought the Ferrari I always wanted. I deserve it more than him.
It happens sometimes I guess	Yes, I don't know how a clown like him ended up with one before I did.
Memories.. what state?	I was thinking about my old neighborhood
I understand but memories are always nice.	Can't say, but I was mostly just thinking about the friends I had there growing up
What happened with your car then?	I needed to use my car to drive somewhere, but couldn't
Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?	My car was hit while parked
I would love that show	I was at a Journey concert with my son and he had to go to the bathroom while they were switching out performers.
Oh well, it happens	It was a very good show, but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.
Have you been to the doctor?	i am suffering from severe fever for the past two days i don't have any energy
You will be fine then	yes i had. he prescribed medicine for curing
Well that is quite the accomplishment.	Sometimes I'm surprised my son is actually my son. He currently has enough merit aid to pay for 2/3 of his college tuition!
He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.	It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best.
Oh man, that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?	I now have a new boss, and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him.  You never know how you will be received.
Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out, but that may be me speaking too prematurely	He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations, and I have to say, I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other, so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.
I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.	My mother will be 85 in a few days. My sister planned a surprise party knowing the day, hour and location would be very difficult for me to attend.
That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.	It is day after tomorrow and I am still not certain I can work it out. Sometimes people are very inconsiderate.
Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?	My cousin just called with the craziest story. She and her family are locked inside a cemetery.
Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?	They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around. I guess her husband lost track of time. The worst thing is they haven't eaten anything since about noon.
I know it is hard to start letting go, but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry, you are not alone.	You hope your teens make the right choices, but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong.  He is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much.  I believe this is healthy, but I can help but want something different.
Yeah, they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.	"That's what my own mother says.  In fact, she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said, ""Hey, I'm staying the night at so and so's, be back tomorrow.""  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!"
That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.	I witness a great sight. I saw a gas station attendant leave his post to pump gas for a lady who has a hard time getting around.
Ohh, that makes sense. Yeah, then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.	The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.
I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad, I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?	I have been fortunate to live a good life but I found a lump in my neck.  Most people would get it checked out immediately.  I waited.  I was scared to get the news.
I'm so glad to hear it was good news, though!	I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it, and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news, but still had to have removed.
Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute, so cherish those you love!	Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family.
It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!	It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.
Coming back to work could be good after a break.	I am off work for a month in the summer, but I today was my first day back, and it felt great to be back on a routine!
I understand	"A month is a great break to ""get away from the daily grind"" but believe me, at the end of week one you think oh, I have all the time in the world, and you aren't as productive."
That isn't good.	I still can't believe I did that. My power had been off and I didn't even realize it.
Did anyone help you?	I arrived at church just as everyone was leaving. Boy did I feel awkward
I wish I could feel that feeling, (unfortunately, I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?	When I was pregnant, I thought so much about what my son would make me feel!
I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.	I named him George, men can have feelings of their sons too. Hopefully one day you will as well.
I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?	Have you ever been hospitalized? It's not much fun. I had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days.
Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.	I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.
That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?	I have a full time job that doesn't pay anything.
Well, as long as you're doing something you enjoy, that's all that really matters.	I love my job, it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma.
Have you figured out what's the problem?	I have a table that is somewhat unsteady, I put my computer on there because I have no where else to put it.
Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent?	I have not, it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though I tell him repeatedly not to do that!
Yes? thats so cute, but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them	My 2 year old daughter keeps picking up random words lately.
OMG, well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them, and also when you are not with them!	I know!  She said the f word!
Are you keeping it as a souvenir?	I went to a concert last weekend and saved the tickets.
Nice, I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.	I am, I plan to scrapbook it once I get the pictures back.
I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?	We recently went camping.  Everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!
Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants, but there was probably none left!	We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!
What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?	This Spring has really made me appreciate family.
Ho, I am sorry to hear that.	My grandmother fell ill, and passed away.
Too late I already took it. Just kidding, did you find it?	I got a notification on my phone that I had a package delivered and went to look for it
Oh, that's bad. Was there anything important in it?	I did, they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!
Wao thats so cool you must so excited, how long has it been?	My son and wife are coming for a visit. Been a long time since I have seen them
Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son, sorry	about a year. I am on the east coast and they moved out west
Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?	I went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year. I had to bring lots of supplies!
Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared.	When I have my son with us I do! My husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and I pulled one out of my purse!
That's cool. I am not a swinger either.	I have been married for ten years. Since we aren't swingers, I'm a one man kinda lady.
How did you do it?	Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.
That makes no sense.	"After a full year of trying to get a leak fixed, I got help from a neighbor's roofer, who ""knew a guy.""  He said the guy didn't work on roofs, so I was confused!"
That seems like a good price.	"Exactly!  The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there, the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out, this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the ""gutter"" on site, and I have had NO leaks!"
right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold	its so hot here. i've had to shower like 3-4 times a day cause you start sweating anyway and it feels icky. Hows the temperature at your place?
haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home	what? where the hell do you live? what do you mean its freezing? oh my god i am so jealous
aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer	ooooh you have an AC, thats why. I live in europe and AC's...arent a thing at all, only the occasional pharmacy will have an AC
I'm sorry, How long has it been?	Oops. I meant I was upset when my dog died.
That's always a tragedy.	Happened in Febuary.
That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?	Last week, my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents. The whole time I was on edge because I wanted to make a good impression.
It probably went well, despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.	Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions, but I think they liked me.
Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?	We love going on our annual family camping trip, and just got back from it!
Oh no, What happened?	We went for a week, but did have to come back to town once.
Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?	I really love being in the great outdoors with my family!
Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?	We went camping, yes.  We're in the Midwest, so no mountains, unfortunately.  But we were near a lake.
Did you get anything extra, like a bonus or a trip.	I did well on a project for a company
Great. What business is it?	I think I might get promoted based on the work
I can tell where this is going.	I was on my way home when a car drove through a huge puddle near the sidewalk
That has never happened to me. Thank god!	I got completely drenched, it was terrible
Well does that make you anxious?	I am a stay at home mom. School just started.
Oh, that would be rough. I've been through that too.	It does, this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten.
Are you happy for him?	A close friend of mine has to leave the state for work
But if is a great opportunity for him, you should be happy.	Kind of, it's going to be sad since I won't see him again most likely
That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?	A friend was able to fix a problem I was having
Bah, those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.	Computer problem.  It was something I couldn't figure out on my own
Why do you think they do that?	My coworkers sometimes put more work on me than necessary.
That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.	They don't want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while.
Oh man, I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.	I moved to tornado alley a few years ago. I'm not used to large tornadoes so I was pretty scared when it started storming.
Jeeeze, yea, it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?	We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced.
It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long, happy, and fulfilling lives!	I love it here, except for the tornadoes and snakes.
That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?	I can't believe I spent 2 hours in the car just to arrive to surf and no waves to be seen.
Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?	Kiteboard but I left half the gear at home. The surf report said 10 foot waves and it's flat water. Not cool bro, not cool
Wow! I've never been anywhere near there.	In 6 days I leave for Peru
I've been to the ocean a few times but I've never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.	It's a surf trip. They have monster waves. I'm nervous.
I live in Tennessee	Do you live inland?
Wow. I must have a boring life then, because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi.	I've been river surfing in Tennessee. You have some decent white water rivers that offer boating and also surfing.
Oh no! How come?	Every single morning one lady on my team comes into my office and cry's
Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someone's home life is like.	You guess is as good as mine. She's crazy. Today she was stressed. Mind you she is 22 lives at home and has no bills.
Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds.	She did mention this morning that her doctor said she needs meds or locked up.
I would save some and maybe get something you need/want?	I can't decide how to spend the $100. I found next to my car this morning.
For sure! Any extra money is always good!	Don't really need anything but it was a great way to start the day.
Had she done that to you before?	I can't I went out with my ex's best friend while we were dating. I was a jerk but it was Karma biting her in the butt.
What a shame!	Right before that I found out she was seeing other people while I was in Iraq.
Congratulations!	Yea, it worked out for the best. A few months after that I meet my wife and we have been together for 11 years now. First baby is on the way in December.
Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?	Got on the scale this morning. Thanks to work stress I lost 15 pounds.
Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!	Yes, that or a new boss. I love my job but my boss is terrible.
Wow, what brand	I can see the kid's car from here. He is 16 and has a car work 100k
That is a nice car	Bmw 8 series. It's my neighbors kid.
Yeah all the time. I get so jealous	Do you see a man and that yea he's got it going on?
Wow, that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!	Yea well I lost 25 pounds and now i'm that guy. Happy in my skin.
That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?	Last time I climbed Elbert I started getting sick from altitude. Heading to Colorado next week to try to climb it again.
Hahaha.  Well, I hope you don't get sick.  Take something salty with you, maybe that will help.  Have fun!	Yes, it's the tallest in Colorado. This will be my 3rd time climbing it. But the first time since I got old and Lazy.
Congratulations. I bet you're happy!	Aced my Real Estate Exam today. Now I'm licensed in two states.
Do you work for a company or on your own?	Yea, time to advance my career now.
Cool beans	I'm self employed but new to the business.
Were you able to get it back?	I was recently waiting to hear from my old apartment about my security deposit refund. I needed the money to pay my new pet deposit, and wasn't sure if I'd get enough money back.
That's great! I bet that was a relief.	I was, and I ended up getting enough to pay the deposit and then some.
Wow, that should have been amazing	I was watching a video about a man who made a small table out of chocolate. It looked real and was just amazing.
Me too, I love chocolate	It really was. It also made me want to eat chocolate.
I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?	I was so happy to watch my friend do a backflip
Oh, that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?	I think he just took gymnastics classes. He luckily did not get hurt!
Are you sick?	I hope the next doctor's appt. that I have goes well. Sometimes they aren't the greatest experience.
That sucks, I will pray for you.	Yeah, I have health problems, it's complicated.
Oh my, that must've been an embarrassing situation!	I can't believe I walked in on someone using the restroom.
That's ok, you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people.	It was! I knocked first and no one answered, so I thought it was okay to go in.
Yes, what about it?	So remember I told you, that I've lost my phone for a moment on a subway?
That was nice of him.	So i guess I just dropped it, and a very old man, picked it up and gave it back to me
Tell me all about it.	I woke up today to a bit of a strange sight.
I try to always go for extra sleep.	Well, it was still dark and too early, but I felt like I had enough sleep.
Wow! 30th is a big milestone birthday! I can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you.	The party that was thrown for me was for my 30th. I think it made friends and family just as happy as it made me.
Did you feel old after?	Thank you! I was glad to share that moment with them.
That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again.	i was frustrated because i could not print a document, and a co worker showed me a keyboard shortcut to find it everytime.
Those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers.	Yes indeed, it was frustrating!  I didn't have time to mess with it everytime i had to print something.
Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.	Some things have changed in my life and my close friends have family have helped me through, which I really appreciate.
Its goof to have support when it does change.	For sure, thank you. Times can change very unexpectedly.
Exactly	Definitely, I think we all need to support each other better in this world.
We would all be better people then	Hopefully we can find some kindness in the world and get the support we all need.
oh wow. Bet it felt amazing. was it a mistake?	One day I randomly got a raise, not something I was expecting!
sounds like a great day. makes you wish it would happen everyday	Thanks! It wasn't a mistake. Just unexpected and pretty neat!
That's so embarrassing! What did you do?	I was at the store and accidentally knocked over some items. I could feel my face turning red.
Did anyone say anything?	I picked them up and tried to move to another area!
Well at least you got away with it this time!	I don't think so. I seem to do these things quite often.
Really? Why was that?	I was flying alone, even though I had before, this particular time I felt wary.
Do you normally feel like that when you fly?	I think I felt concerned that the plane would crash or that something else bad might happen.
I can understand that, flying is scary.	I was traveling on a plane by myself and I felt kind of scared.
I'm glad you didn't get hurt.	It is. We ended up going through a thunderstorm.
Hey, do you have anything on your mind?	Hello!
I agree, incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems.	Yeah! i just received an email from guild wars 2 customer support, I lost my game code so i couldnt recover my account (forgot password), and they sent an email back asking me for the code. its so surprising having to deal with people this stupid, you would think that they would never get hired to begin with
oh I am so sorry for your loss.	I recently lost my dog, after 13 years.
I bet. You gave him a good long life, that was the best you could do.	Yeah, it was terrible.  Heart wrenching to bury him.
I am sorry it was so stressful	When a spot came open for a supervisor job at my employer, that was a stressful week for me.
Just hope for the best	They had many qualified candidates and it took a full week for them to make their decision.
ugh thats the worst right.. everyone should have holidays off.	I had to work the day that my boyfriend and his family went to a Christmas party.
I say skip work next time :p go for it	It wasn't even a holiday, just on a Saturday during the day because the drive was so long.
i just love that, my son knows ASL	When my daughter was a baby she couldn't talk so I taught her sign language.
i wish schools would teach kids asl	That's great! I taught her a few words that were interesting to her so she could tell us what she needed.
she wants to spend time with you	My sister in law planned a get together during a time we couldn't go.
that was nice of her	Well no, she knew we couldn't go out late because of my son's bedtime and scheduled it anyway.
its a beautiful place	My mother in law wanted to take my daughter to Colorado, but she is only 3.
in that case i agree then	I'm sure it is, but she is very young and still looks for me in the morning.
Where are you going on vacation?	We were going on vacation and I made a list of everything we could possibly need when we were there.
That is close for me, but it is a fun time!	We went to New Jersey, so a long way for us. We had a toddler, so I had to make sure I had everything for her.
i admire that	I seem to be always alert, so that even something loud happens, I remain calm.
no its not	I just wander, is this normal?
I see, have you tried yoga and meditation?	I have been having bad Anxiety for months. I cante seem to get a to stop.
Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved!	Nope.But have been practicing breathing and muscle relaxation
Oh my, you must have very surprised!	I was having my second baby and my friends threw me a baby shower without me knowing.
It must have been an enjoyable day. You have nice friends!	Yes, I was not expecting it at all. They invited us over to hang out.
i bet she was so excited!! Did she love her presents?	I couldn't sleep on Christmas eve. I was ready to see my daughter's face when she woke up in the morning.
that was me last christmas lol my son was only 9 months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction	Yeah she did, but I guess I was looking forward to it more than she was.
Oh no. Why are you worried to lose it?	I really like my job. I'm worried that I will lose it.
Oh no.. That is a bit scary. I wish the best for you!	I don't have as much work to do as in the past and no one needs help with anything.
I am, thank you for asking!	Thanks! I hope more work will come soon. Are you doing well?
Oh no, why not?!	I ordered a pizza today, but it really wasn't a pleasant experience.
They really can't. It's still no excuse though.	The guy that took my order was rude, but I understand, most people can't control themselves...
Oh that sucks...did she explain herself yet	I can't believe my friend wouldn't answer her phone when I waited over an hour for her to pick me up!
Sounds like you need a new friend or your own car...or both lol	No, she just completely blew me off. I found out she was out on a date instead and didn't tell me.
That's terrible.  Someone should call animal control on them.	My neighbor is the worst! He has a dog that he just keeps chained up in the backyard, and he rarely feeds it. Last week I saw it and he looks anorexic.
I hope they do something to help that poor puppy.	I know, what kind of human being would do that to a poor dog! I'm going to call animal control soon.
what happened ?	i was so shocked by the behavior of my friends dog
did he end up biting you??	when i knocked on the door i felt the door was open and i thought as he is in home itself i felt i can go in but suddenly his dog jumped on me
Oh no, that's terrible!  Are both you and your dog alright now?	My dog got really sick and was coughing up blood last week. I didn't know what to do. I had a panic attack.
Yes, that would have frightened me too.  I'm glad he's alright now.	Yes, I took him to the vet and got him the help he needed. The possibility of losing my best friend had me frightened!
I hope and wish so. In this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities	Financially, things will turn around for my family soon!
Being optimistic will help you alleviate much of your accumulated stress	Yes, and we had a layoff of five months.  I believe in a brighter day, though, so I know it will improve.
that is literally the worst, the people should have atleast told you to go ahead  first!	I was in a check out lane for a while waiting when another cashier comes alone and takes the people in the back of the line.
its really so rude. ugh im sorry	Oh I know. People just gladly go, but the cashiers should be taught to take the next person in line.
I love dogs too what breed do you have ?	I love hanging out with my dog in nature, it makes me feel good.
i have a german shepard	I have a 4 yr old golden do you have any?
That's awesome.  What did it take for you to get there	Where at I am in life, currently, is at peace with everything around me. It is a first for me, and it is simply amazing.
Sounds like you've gotten smarter and more observant over the years	A lot of years struggling, and finalizing realizing that the struggle is the normal part of it all.  Acceptance and steadfastness led to happiness, I guess.
Oh how gross! I don't like possums anyways	I once saw a dead possum in my garbage it smelled terrible lol.
Just lizards and gators. I live in South Florida haha	Yeah me neither lol any wildlife where you live?
I have heard about that game.  I heard there was one guy that makes about $500,000 a month playing it on the streaming service Twitch.  Maybe your son should give it a try.	Recently, I've been watching my son play a game called Fortnite. It blows my mind how good he is at such a fast game.
Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.  Go ahead and retire now and get him started!	I have never heard of Twitch.  That is a lot of money, I could retire!
I'm sorry your friend moved away. Sounds like me when I moved from Indiana to Florida. My friend was upset when I left too.	My friend got a promotion and moved to California last week. I always thought I would be the first one to get out of this dump.
That is your friend, you should be happy for them!	He doesn't deserve to live in luxury! He gets to chill on the beaches and I'm stuck out here in the dessert.
Aw I am happy for you! What do you go to school for?	I'm excited to go to school full time again in the fall!
That is great! Good luck to you!	Engineering its tough but I think its really cool.
I bet! I can't imagine what that must be like to see a bran new life.	Watching my first child being born changed my life forever.
That's awesome :) I'm happy for you! Hopefully one day I will get to see that	It changed my whole outlook on everything.  I have never felt such happiness condensed in such a short period of time/
Hopefully the things coming out of his mouth are good things, right?	I stay home with my five year old son. Sometimes I hear things come out of his mouth that I know he learned from me.
Oh.  I recommend correcting that before it gets out of hand.  Good luck!	I wish, he sometimes says curse words.
What movie were you watching?	I've been watching movie a few hours ago, and still feel its effects.
That is a great movie.	I think it was called Rampage.
I do.  It feels great to get out into nature doesn't it?	I had a great time hiking with my family and dog recently! Do you like nature?
The beach is my most favorite place to go.	Yeah I always enjoy hiking in the mountains or just going to the beach.
That sounds rough, were you able to get accustomed to Texas?	When I moved to Texas I didn't know anyone but my boyfriend.
I know what you mean, that happened to me when I left for college a few years ago.	Yeah, but I had left all my family behind. I didn't know anyone here for quite some time.
Wow that is really confident on your end. Are you going to do anything with the girl	We got a new girl in class yesterday and I bet my friends that I could get her number! Let's just say lunch was on them.
That sounds exciting. Just make sure she is okay with it all before!	Well that's the attitude you have when you look like Brad Pitt. Maybe take her out to the movies and try to get to second base.
What was she referring to then?	We were talking to my husband's grandma and she asked about the rain hitting us. I thought she was talking about the rain we got on the way to see her, but she wasn't.
I see.  Do you get a lot of storms in your location?	She was talking about the rain storms that hit earlier in the week, and asked if we were effected by them.
I always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation	Not too much, but when she asked I said we did, but we were talking about two different things.
That movie is a classic! I loved it as a kid!	"Yesterday we watched ""The Land Before Time"" in class. That movie brings back so many memories."
Hahah! That is awesome!	Yes, I remember we used to call one of my friends Petrie because he looked exactly like him.
get them reported	My new hotel neighbors are very noisy.
You are welcome, if you take your stand they will  behave	I might just do it, thank you.
I bet you're both excited and nervous about it! I have two kids of my own and one will be starting in about a year while the other is going to fourth grade.	My son starts kindergarten next week, I am a stay at home mom. I want to get caught up on scrapbooking my pictures of him!
I'm sure it will! I hope it all works out for you.	I had all these plans when I had my son, they didn't work out but I am wishing that this does!
That's always a good thing. It means you should get on great with your neighbors.	I recently discovered that there are plenty of like minded people around where I live.
Most of my neighbors are good, kind people too, so I know just what you mean.	Yes, Just knowing that I'm not alone is such a great feeling.
Why did you feel anxious?	i felt anxious during my work. the finance related work which gives me satisfaction
Hmm.. I'm a little confused.  Why were you anxious?	i love my job. i eagerly awaited to achieve and go  as long as i want in my life.
Well that's sweet. How did the policeman react?	We were eating ice cream last night and my son walked over to a police officer and started talking to him.
Oh wow! That's awesome! Your son sounds like he has a bright future!	He was so nice, he even volunteered to set up a meeting with the mayor and my son!
I've done that before. Getting over that initial fear is really hard. But it's fun once you do!	My took me white water rafting with him last week. When we got to the river I started having second thoughts.
I understand completely. It's that initial anxiety. It's a scary thing to do!	I know, but since it was my first time I didn't know how to act. My mind started to go blank and I started to sweat profusely.
I bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time.	I couldn't wait for my mom to finally get here from New Jersey. She would stay about a week and a half.
its always nice when grandmas come visit.	Yeah, she would be able to see the kids, and she hardly ever comes to visit.
Oh wow, that sounds like it might be cool but I don't know what that looks like, what is the 900?	Last week, my brother landed a 900 on his skateboard like Tony Hawk at a skating competition.
Yea, how old is your brother?	It's when you turn a skateboard 900 degrees while spinning in the air. It's very hard to do, so you can imagine the look on my face when I saw my brother do it.
I love camping, and understand why a hammock is your favorite. They're so comfortable!	We go camping a lot during the summer. My favorite piece of equipment is my hammock!
That sounds amazing, as long as you're not reading scary books about the woods!	They are, I love to read a good book while hanging out in the hammock!
I agree. Camping and hammocks are for relaxing and letting the mind be free.	I wouldn't do that! Just a good book, where I didn't have to think much!
I've actually never gone there. What's it like?	I really enjoy going to Disney because it makes me feel very nostalgic for my childhood.
That's good to hear. I do plan on taking my kids in the future!	It's pretty awesome! Lots to do for adults as well. I tend to go to Epcot quite often with my annual pass. We live right down the street.
Do you live in Flordia? I have family down there and was really worried about them.	I was pretty shook up last year when Hurricane Irma came through Florida.
That was lucky. Losing power is bad, but at least that was it. Scary situation.	Yes, I live in Orlando so I was lucky that it was central, but we were out of power for a few days.
What will happen if the secret is told?	I really feel good when my friends keep my secrets. (Or at least I think they do!)
Of course, I only tell them the best ones though!	Not much, I just value my privacy. Do you have secrets that you tell your friends?
Oh no, was she upset at you or about something else?	My sister in law got upset when she was over and I was trying to talk to her about it.
Well that's really kind of you to help her like that. She's lucky to have you!	About something else and I wanted to talk to her and make her feel better.
Ugh, people can be so rude. Was he able to go to the bathroom?	I was at a concert a few weeks ago with my son and he had to go to the bathroom.  There were so many people there, mostly adults, and they refused to move so we could make it to the family bathroom.
That's awful!! So what did you end up doing? Did he just have to pop a squat?	He was not, there were just too many people standing around not moving.
As long as you work hard and stay dedicated, I'm sure it will come!	I'm really hopeful that I'll land a new promotion at work.
Absolutely! And if you trust your boss, I'm sure he will do the right thing.	I hope so! Hard work and dedication tend to pay off.
Thats scary.  Did you have to pull over?	As we were driving on the highway we got caught in a big storm.
I take it you made it out safe beacuse we're here chatting	No we kept driving but the rain was real bad and trucks were swerving.
That sounds like an awesome Christmas present!  I've actually thought about doing that with my girls now that they are older and not much they really need.  Where are you going?	My parents told me that we would be going on a cruise vacation at Christmas. I couldn't believe it!
I've ALWAYS wanted to go on a Disney cruise - it's probably my dream vacation. I'm so jealous!!!	We went on the cruise in February. It was a Disney cruise in the Bahamas! What a great experience.
That's such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time. What was your major?	I was so glad when I graduated college
I totally get that. I majored in business but sometimes I wish I majored in engineering. I'm kind of glad I didn't though. It's hard!	Communications. It was a little tough but not engineering tough!
Aww, that is very nice of them. i just had to put mine down a few weeks ago.	My family is so supportive. They even flew out when my last dog passed away and spent some time with me to make me feel better.
Border Collie. Yours?	I'm so sorry to hear that. What kind of breed was your dog?
I can imagine! Did you end up having a good flight?	I was very scared when flying for the first time
That's good! Hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!	I did. Luckily no turbulance!
Aww, was he scared?	My son starts school soon, we had a fun day out but when we got home he was really bad.
I can see that. School is a challenging time for a kid.	I don't think so, I think he was just over the day and it was too much for him.
Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in?	I was very ready going into my test
Man, I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it?	Engingeering. It was really tough!
Another man's trash is another man's treasure! What things do you save?	Anytime we take a trip, I normally save what some people consider trash.
I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?	Just different things that I can scrapbook, mementos from my trip.
I'm so sorry that happened to you. How did you handle this situation?	My pants feel down when riding my bike
I hope no one saw that, it must've been terrible.	I just pulled them up. it was just embarassing.
How are you going to learn! Why are you afraid to go?	I was scared to go to school
It ain't so bad. I'm sure you'll make a few new friends and everything will be just fine.	Just nervous about all the people
Please describe what scared you about the caves.	I was scared of going into the caves
That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!	Just the darkness.
Is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?	We live in a very high cost of living area but don't make a ton of money.
I do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes, don't put yourself down over it.	I'm not sure, sometimes I wish I had what the other people around me had.
That must be so annoying. I get that sometimes too.	Sometimes people ask me to do a lot of other stuff when I already have a lot on my plate.
I'm sad to hear that, I'm sure there is someone who cars.	I feel like people don't care that I have stuff to do.
That's good to hear that you care for your son so much. I am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best.	My son went to the best preschool. When I needed him to stay late, they always had space for him.
Yeah, my village helped with my son's preschool tuition as well. Strength in numbers and good neighbors!	I hope so, it really helps to get your village when you have kids.
Oh yuck! Where did that happen?	I was so grossed out when I saw someone vomit
During dinner? ACK!	At Fazolis. It was so gross.
Can you tell me about your recent experience?	hello
Yeah, I love Star Wars. I was sad when Han Solo died. He was my favorite character!	i couldnt believe it when i heard they are making even more new star wars movies
That would make me sad, did you let him go?	My husband went to go hang out with his guy friends leaving me all alone.
I know how you feel, I'm sorry about that, at least he probably came back pretty quickly.	Yeah, I mean I didn't want to tell him he couldn't. I just don't like being by myself.
I'm sure they will understand. You can always have another dinner, that's the beauty of life!	I felt upset when I forgot to ask my friend to dinner.
Where did you end up going?	That is true. Good way to look at things!
Oh no, have you look at other options?	Tomorrow's my last day of work. I can't believe it. I wish I had something lined up.
I really hope you get it!	I have and tried negotiating with my old work. I have an interview next week with another company so I hope that goes well!
Oh no. Did you flip him off?	I was so mad when some guy cut me off in traffic!
That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst, though.	No, I remained calm, but I was very mad!
Wow, that's super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early, but that's not very respectful to neighbors.	i couldnt stand it when my neighbor was using power tools at 8 am on a saturday
Have you talked to him about it?	nope, it was very frustrating, he lives next door too
are you getting laid off?	I'm pretty worried about what the future will hold. I lose my job tomorrow. Trying to keep my head up!
im sorry, i hope you're able to find an even better job immediately	Yes, unfortunately. We are having a huge company layoff and being a remote employee didn't help my case.
Do you live in Florida?	I was really scared when Hurricane Irma came through Florida last year. It was a pretty horrible experience.
Wow, that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.	I do, in Orlando. I feel lucky to have had no damage to my home and been in a central location, but the storm was awful and we had no power for 4 days.
Thats amazing, you must be a good person	I work online to make extra money for things my family wants.
How many kids do you have?	It's nice to be able to pay for fun things that our budget doesn't allow us to normally do.
Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me. Alone can be good.	i felt bored being by myself all week
Well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.	it was just boring because i had so much work to get done
I am so sorry to hear that!	My son's school starts next week and they just changed the first day of school!
That is the worst. At least you and your husband got something worked out for your son's first day at school!	My husband had to ask off for a different day without much notice!
A walk down memory lane.	I was looking through my cloud and found some pics of when I was little.
Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories.	Yeah, it makes me miss being at home and around my family.
oh that can be annoying, did you tell him anything?	I was watching my favorite tv show and my husband kept talking to me during it.
hahah that's kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!	I just gave him a look. The thing is he says I do that instead of waiting til commercial, but then he goes and does it to me.
Nice! Where did you go?	I was glad my dad asked me to go on a mission trip with him.
Oh, that is really cool! What a great experience, and fun to bond with your dad!	Belize. He did doctor stuff. I didn't do much. But it was cool to see what they were up to.
Was it long?	i was upset sitting in traffic yesterday
That's long, I understand the reason behind you being upset	about an hour
I know how you feel, it's always good to bond with your buddies when you can	My friends were finally coming over to visit, it had been a long time since I saw them last.
Thank God you will be able to tell them in person about how much you miss them	Yeah, I really miss seeing them since they moved.
Oh yea, I can relate to the good times, is she still alive?	i have good memories when i see photos of my grandmother
oh no. May her soul rest in peace	no unfortunately she isnt
Congrats! I'm sure you will have great memories.	Well last week my husband and I celebrated our 10th wedding anniversary.
I believe you will just continue doing what you've already done.	We do.  10 years being loyal and true to each.  I just hope we have many more!
Yes I am married	thats true.  Are you married yet yourself?
I am happy and yes its a lot of work. Anything worth having takes work to keep it.	I hope you are as happy as I am.  Its nots easy though, a work in progress, but worth it all in the long run.
HAve you been practicing? Do you have note cards?	I have a presentation tonight, I'm nervous but I still think I'll ace it.
I hope you do well. IS it for school?	I don't want to use note cards as I look better without them. I did use them while practicing though.
Well congratulation on your A in advance lol	Thanks, yeah it is for a summer class in macroeconomics.
Oh my gosh! Was it a wild tarantula or a pet?	A tarantula bit me in my living room the other day and I thought I was going to die.
Thank goodness! The biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider. They don't really bite you unless you irritate them.	It was a wild tarantula. I had my family rush me to the hospital, but I ended up being just fine. It only caused me discomfort for a couple of days.
Oh awesome! How are they doing?	Last week, my childhood friend came to visit from out of town. I couldn't stop smiling when we hung out.
Awesome! It's nice to see people who knew you so long ago. No friendships like those!	Great. We were just cracking jokes the whole time. It was good to see him.
Wow, that's really great. What charity did he donate to?	Yesterday, my brother came out on the news because he was taking about the new charity he started. I'm glad I have brother with such a good heart.
Oh, sorry. That's awesome. What does his charity support?	No, he's starting his own. I'm glad I'm able to call him my bro.
Was the weather nice?	My daughter wanted to go outside and play so I sat out there with her.
I can't wait until we get nice weather. ITs too hot to do anything	Yes it was nice outside. I felt very relaxed out there.
Some people have no concept of being rude.	I was in a long line at the supermarket the other day. Then some lady just cut right in front of me like nothing.
no, they dont.	It mad me sick! Do they teach these people about manners?
Are you serious? That is extremely terrible news to hear. :(	I was diagnosed with stage four cancer yesterday. The doctor told me I have less than a month to live.
I really wish I knew what to say, but even watching my mother go thru stage 4 I still dont know what to say! Spend a lot of time with your loved ones!	Yes, I fell to my knees when I heard the news and haven't stopped crying since. My life is pretty much over!
Really, isn't that unusual?	When my daughter was a baby she picked up sign language really well.
I'm glad it worked out so well for you all .	Not really, I was trying to teach her so she could communicate with us and tell us what she wanted.
I know how stressful that can be. I hope everything turned out alright.	Yesterday, I was at the doctors office all day waiting for my blood tests. I was hoping everything would turn out alright.
That is great news!	The wait turned out to be worth it because the results showed that everthing was fine.
That wasn't nice. I hope they caught them.	I was so annoyed earlier - went back to get my car after doing my shopping and someone had hit it and driven off!
That sucks, how much is it?	No unfortunately not.  There were no cameras in the carpark and no one saw anything.  So i am left with the bill.  I hope karma gets them eventually though.
I can relate. You just have to be yourself.  Do you know if you got the job?	I was applying for a manager position at the store I worked at. I felt really sure about the interview.
That?檚 great!  How do you like it?	Yeah they offered me the job. I was very excited.
Is it sunny where you are ?	i am really happy about the weather today
Glad for you, it's cloudy and humid here.	yes and warm but not too hot
Why did you wait a week? Tell her to tell him	My friends girlfriend kissed me at a party last week. It's been weighing heavy on my mind. Should I tell him?
I don't know. You should have told hime when it happended. Just do it and get uit out of the way so you both can move past it.	But, he's been my best friend since childhood. I think I should be the one to tell him. I just feel so bad. That's why I postponed it.
That's nice. I always like getting letters.	i got a letter from my grandmother in the mail today
no, I never did. It might have been nice.	did you ever have a pen pal when you were a child?
58 million. That's unbelievable.	My friend won 58 million when he hit the jackpot the other day. I don't understand, why cant good stuff like that happen to me?
Well, you know how to get it from  him right?	I couldn't believe he won it because he's so stingy and I'm such a kind hearted person. I deserve it more!
ah congratulations on the engagement! How long have you two been together?	Yesterday, I went engagement ring shopping and I picked out the perfect ring for my wife.
No problem. I hope she'll love it as well.	Thanks buddy. We have been dating for 2 years on and off. I can't wait to show her the ring. I like it a lot and I think she will too.
Oh no. Did you guys talk about it?	I was upset when my friend forgot to invite me to dinner
No one's perfect. I hope you won't hold a grudge.	We did. He apologized, but I just hate that he forgot me.
How'd it go?	I had a major work presentation to give
Being prepared pays off soemtimes.	It went well, I felt like I had everything in order
how did you do on it?	I took a work related placement test for a better position in my company
Good, well I hope you get the better position!	I did well overall, it was easier than I thought
How strict is the budget?	Just started my budget. Apparently I'm going to be ok.
Ah, that makes sense, well I hope it goes well for you!	Down the last dollar. I have a baby on the way so we've got to bank money
Nice. Did his team finish first?	i was impressed by my nephews performance at his little league baseball game
At his age, they progress very quickly	they won the game and he played really well
That's very nice of them! Having caring friends is very important.	i really appreciated all the effort my friends put into my birthday
What did they do for you?	yes it is
I bet it does, you should find a podcast you like	I'm over the road trucker. Man it gets boring in the evenings.
That is smart, I would recommend a nintendo switch!	I listen to most of those as I drive. I was thinking of getting into gaming. I have a Tv in the truck and can buy a game system.
How so?	I see a lot of work coming up at my job
I'm sorry. Any way you can get out of it?	My supervisor warned me earlier in the week about it
Why's that?	I was scared to fly for the first time
Have you always been scared of heights?	Because I am scared of heights.
Yuck!  You didn't get wet and muddy I hope!	i couldnt believe it rained this afternoon after such a sunny morning
That is good to hear.  No one likes soggy shoes!	nope it only rained for a few minutes
Backflips are scary. Neck injury is serious.	I was really proud of my friend for doing a backflip
Thats good! They do look cool too.	Yes, but luckily he completed it without hurting anything.
I was scared the first and only time I flew also. Where were you flying to?	I was scared to fly for the first time
Oh wow! I bet that was really exciting. I have never been out of the country.	Europe. So a long flight!
You must feel horrible!  Get her something extra nice and I am sure she will forgive you!	I feel bad for forgetting about my mom's birthday
Get her flowers and a gift certificate to a nice massage place!	What should I get her?
I have the same feeling. I miss her also	I was thinking about how I missed my grandma
Sorry to hear that	She passed last year. She is in a better place.
Are you going to have it completed in time?  I hope you are not behind schedule!	I have a work project coming up that needs to be completed
Ouch!  You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!	I still have much to be done
Wow! I would be amazed too!	So I walked into work this morning. I have a new boss. He's 20 and had a PhD. I'm amazed.
That's so true. Im 30 and just now having the time to work on my bachelors. But I have a lot of work experience.	A little worried. While super smart as we get older we gain real world experience in dealing with people that you can not learn in a book. But still at 20 I was struggling with my associates degree.
Same here. Well I hope he can adapt and do well. Good luck with your BA too!	I'm 34 and still working on the BA as well. When life got in the way education had to take a back seat.
Wow. That's pretty hypocritical.	So ever single day my boss is late to work. 20 minutes or more. Today I was 1 minute late, first time in 2 years and I got a wrote up.
I think she's just trying to cause a problem.	Yea, I even called and let them know the highway was closed down and I was going to be late. I even text her photo of the traffic accident once I got up to it.
Did you not have your own food?	I was hungry and took my co-workers food
Oh no! That sounds horrible! Did the co-worker find out?	I didn't have any that day, I was also out of money
Oh wow. Give me the details.	This morning I don't know what got into me but on the way to work I picked up a homeless guy.
Are you missing an organs?	Yea, as I pulled over I thought it was someone down on his luck. Nope, he was crazy.
Well, At least you're in one piece. you could have been in several.	Haha, it started off ok. He was going to the train station. I agreed to take him. With in minutes he was talking to him self.
Not really? How come?	Went on a first date last weekend. Had some sort of BBQ appetizer early in the date. Yummy, yea well not really!
Oh wow, the BBQ must be delicious.	Well, after about an hour I got up to pee. As I washed my hands I looked up and my face was covered with sauce. It looked like someone poured it on my face,
"That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted, especially when some people say it's in its ""worst state in a long time."" We're prisoners of the moment."	Do you ever wake up and realize how lucky we are? I travel a lot and I just got back from Haiti. I'm convinced it's better to be poor in America then rich in Haiti.
Yeah, I guess you would know for sure, since you've seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti, that's just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti, if you don't mind me asking?	Those that criticize have not traveled the real world out side resort gates or into the third world. Then you see a real state that is in trouble.
I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?	Monday I was downtown for work. I was on my way home when a homeless man asked form some money. I went to reach for my wallet and it was gone.
That story could become a movie script.	No it was stolen. So when I went to reach for it. The homeless man could tell something was wrong. He actually paid for my train ticket home. I end up seeing him again today. Took him out to lunch and gave him some money.
That?檚 a bummer. Drink some coffee	All I want in life this weekend is to sleep and I have to work.
Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda	Coffee dose even phase me anymore. The lack of sleep is making my soul sad.
Is it not going to happen?	This weekend was supposed to be my first weekend off in 2 months.
That sucks.	Nope, my boss who only works one weekend a month has decided this month she is not going to work any weekends.
You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!	Yea, she is not a very good boss and now I'm super bummed.
What's ELS?	I recently took my ELS certification test. I studied really hard, so I'm sure I passed it.
Ah, gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses	Sorry, ESL. It's English as a Second Language. It just means I am certified to teach students that don't speak fluent English.
That really sucks! What do you have to do?	I just moved into my new house and I am having a cockroach problem.
I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this	I'm just using Raid right now, but I will call an exterminator tomorrow. I hate bugs so I am freaking out a little bit.
Wow. I had that DVD.	When I was in New York, I got to see STOMP. It was an amazing show.
I know. I wonder if they still do that show	I used to watch it in music class a lot. I am fascinated by the way they make music with everyday items.
Some dads are cool like that. My mom is that way sometimes.	I love my dad. He only made me pay half of the money I owed him and let me keep the rest for my pet deposit.
I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything	I was shocked. I was fully prepared to pay the full thing. He's great.
Are you a busdriver?	my bus broke down and i was late for work, again!
Ah, gotcha. I hate it when things happen out of our control. Hope you get it figured out	no i ride a bus to work. this has happened twice in the past month. i need to get a car
Hi what you got going on?	Hey there
That is really sad.  Are you alright?	Uhm.. just feeling blue. My gf broke up with me recently and got married to an investment banker
I'm sorry.  Will you be able to pass this semester/	I feel so bad that i failed my last semester exam
I'm sure it will happen.	I am doing my best to pass
I am sure you will do well!	i will be presenting my project to the company and am tensed about it
I don't think you will need to worry then.	Yes, i have prepared for two months now
Sorry to hear that. Why did they not attend?	My best friend had arranged for my birthday party, but she did not attend, i feel so bad
Hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon.	he was at work
Ha, hope you aren't too scarred about being all by yourself.	my parents went on vacation and i am left aloe in the house
Watching too many horror movies I bet. Just put on some comedy special.	i am scared, especially at night
That's quite an accomplishment. You must have worked very hard.	Man I am so glad I was able to climb out of poverty.
That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.	I was homeless for about a year.  It felt like every day I would just descened even further.  But I always held out hope that things would get better.
That's very good. It takes a disciplined person to save money	I'm so pleased with myself right now.  I saved up enough money to make all of my car payments at once next month.
You truely are determined to get that car, what brand is it?	Heh, well I didn't exactly save money that mush.  I just hunkered down and started working harder and asked for more hours.
I hope you pass your exam. Did you do good at your exam?	i am confident i am going to pass my exam
Good luck	yes, i always read hard
Really? What happened?	Man I had an absolute blast from the past last week.
Wow, cool! Did they let you in? It's so cool you had that opportunity.	I found my old elementary school.  I hear it was going to be torn down next month, so I toured the inside.
Ick. I've never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that.	Yeah I went to a used car lot yesterday to check out a car I saw on the internet.  Not happy.
Ah, I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy	Well I realzied that the owner had taken the pictures of the car from a large distance.  Up close it was very disappointing.
Hi, tell me what's going on with you?	hi
Oh, I'm well thank you.	not going.hoe are u?
Oh really? Any reason why?	Man I am so cheesed off today!
Wow really? That's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.	Yeah I was buying something in electronics and this guy shows up out of nowhere and starts criticizing my purchase!
Do tell	You'll never guess what I saw on the road today.
That's neat! I've only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once, though	I saw a bear crossing the road a mile from my job.
I guess it didn't turn out well?	Man I was so stoked to check my bank account today
oh.  SWEET!  Congrats!  What are you going to do with all that money??	No man it was GREAT.  I finally got my first paycheck after my rasie!
Save it for Spider-Man that comes out next month!  I can't wait for that	Well I was gonna buy a few video games, but I'll of course set some aside.  No need to go crazy.
And more to come hopefully!  Don't forget to save for retirement and/or emergency fund :D	Thinking about it!  But  I may not have to, as by then I'll get another paycheck at this pay grade!
Hello	hi
Am doing well thanks and you?	how are you?
hi	hi
fine. But, I think you're suppose to do the prompts, so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection.	how are you?
What have your experiences been like?	hi
That's good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.	so nice my experience.
Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate?	I feel angry i have to pay with an interest
It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.	yes, it is exorbitant just to say
You read	One of my friends sent me a lot of money for my birthday right when I needed it a lot.
That's great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable	I do read a lot of articles.
Oh my god, that must have been so embarrasing! Was there actually a fire?	There was one time when I was in grade school and the fire alarm went off when I was in the bathroom.  I had a hard time buttoning my pants up and had to walk out holding them together in front of my classmates.
Its okay, at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment.	Nope, it turned out to be a fire drill.  Everyone was laughing at me.  It wasn't one of my prouder moments.
Oh no, I hate having connectivity problems! Are you having bad weather?	I am sitting here and guessing when will the wi-fi stop working.
Oh, it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working!	Yep its raining cats and dogs in here.
Yes, I am here	Is anyone here?
Oh no, I bet that was stressful. What did you do?	Yes, I had fully charged it and after like 6-7 rides it had 3% left.
I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?	Recently I've been enjoying being by myself.
Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts, but still be around others. I love to watch people!	I just love people watch, if that's considered alone time.
Yes I can related to that feeling	When I wake up and know that I am doing the things that I like, I feel great.
Well, a great morning leads to a great day	I don't think people realize iportance of that in their life.
Which movie did you watch?	i watched a horror movie and i feel terrified and anxious all the time
That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?	lost
What was hurtful may I ask?	It was really hurtful
That sounds like very bad treatment, You should sue them	Well, they made me leave everything at my desk, walked me downstairs, turn in my badge, and would mail my belonings.
Maybe you haven't done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think that's it?	I feel very strange for not feeling any remorse about anything really.
Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way, they could be experiencing depression.	I think it might just be a stage in life.
I suppose it is.	Is it terribleto always feel ok, and not wait for the bad times
You always have options!	Than I will go on feeling this way I guess, or do I have another option?
Sounds like someone who is actually not a friend. How long have you known her?	She was actually always blind-sinding nice to my face and back-stabbing the other.
I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.	I have known her less than a year.
I can't say that I really do. It's always a mystery in my mind.	Do you ever feel that now you have finally grasped what life really is..
I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.	Or is the sign of overconfidence, like they say, -  there are two types of bikes, those that were in an accident, and those that will be?
I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to, but lately it just has so much rotten food	Some markets have to be avoided, that is if you valued your sense of smell.
Totally. I still love to go have a look around	Yet there's still something about that imperfection, do you agree?
Yes, it is partially true. What is the problem?	Don't you think that the only one really capable of bringing you down, is you?
I understand.	There aren't any, I am just drawing a conclusion from past experience.
That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?	Sometime all it take is one rude person to ruin your day.
Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.	Nothing major, but I am still learning how to deal with such behavior and always open for an advice.
Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.	when i went for shopping i parked my car at a no parking zone which i am not aware , police approached the car and was about to tow it away
Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies, too. Did they understand?	yes exactly , but i also had my 4 6 month old 11 month old baby with me .
That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.	ya after they had seen my 11 month old baby with me they felt they should not trouble me by towing away car . i felt very thankful to them
I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.	gosh ive been feeling so nervous for the past 24 hours, its almost like an impending sense of doom, To my knowledge theres nothing about to go wrong or blow up in my face but it feels like something is going badly
Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.	i ordered some semi expensive tablet yesterday so maybe its that but like, i cant think of a logical reason why that would go wrong so im left wondering why i feel so nervous, its really weird, very hard to relax like this
I think it's very common that we take things for granted.	I've been recently thinking about the things we don't appreciate.
I think you can really think about all that you have, and show your thanks that you have these things.	Is there anything that can change that?
What was depressing?	Yah, was depressing.
Oh, that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?	Well, just really did a lot of housework and felt we lost contact.
What is the name of the show?	have you ever watched this show it was really quite good?
No, I ever did.	It was called Hero's
why hasnt it already been returned?	I am currently waiting to receive my security deposit back from my old apartment.
if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner, i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you	They said it takes up to 30 days, and it's only been a few weeks.
yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me, Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you	Wow, that's good to know.
That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl, but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer.	I ordered a surface pro yesterday! its gonna be so cool to play around with when it arrives
I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago, but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.	i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it, i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it, and then just stop
what was ?	It was such a sweet moment.
oh that does sound nice	Spending time watching TV and sipping wine together.
Well in some ways solitude is nice.	As the day was coming to an end, I was begging to believe that my solitude was perfect.
True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.	Yes if you take it in portions.
Be responsible about what?	But I needed to be responsible.
I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too, before I can go out.	Well, about getting daily chorses done--work first-- play later.
Oh no, sorry to hear, hope you are OK.	I got backed into last week by another car.
I agree. Hope the car will look good again.	I'm fine, but they left a nasty dent in the front of my car. Now I have to get it fixed, which is a hassle.
Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?	Meh i kinda feel bad, i wish i had family members to talk to
I understand	friends are cool but its not quite the same as a family member, a spouse would be but i dont have that either!
I agree, where did you find them?	Yah, two colored socks is crazy.
Oh I see, Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!	LOL, mixed up in my drawer.
Was it an accident?	when i was travelling alone in a car at night in ghat road suddenly some boulders fell on the road
Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close	no the boulders fell 50 meters infront of me , luckily i was going slow and suddenly stopped
do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?	I ate so many macadamia nuts today, I don't know how to feel about it.
It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?	It the only nut that I can eat, that's why I can't help overeating.
It's awful out there. It's been in the 100's here in TX	its sooooooo hot outside, 30c. its borderline impossible to deal with
That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs, so I feel your annoyance.	oh no, texas is basically in a desert isnt it. for me on top of heat i also get some 3 wasps a day flying into my apartament and looking around, i just got one earlier and had to kill it to get rid of it. very annoying, apparently wasps love it though
what job did you apply to?	I start back at work in a couple of weeks.
Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :P (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society	I'm a teacher, so I've been off this summer. I am looking forward to having 12th graders again this year.
Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome	I always trust my family like my mom to give me good advice.
Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?	Do you ever disagree with your Mom?
Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here?	Aww, I didn't really relate until I had children of my own
I'm sorry to hear that	i was really pissed off when i found out my best friend slept with my girlfriend. i was shaking all over!
:( did you stay friends with him?	yeah well. what you gonna do.. thats life..
did you get admission?	i had recently applied for graduate masters in very prestigious universities but initially i was worried whether i get admission or not
That's great news, well done.	yeah i thought the competition was tough and i may not get admitted, but luckily i was admitted
:)	yes i am totally relived of that stress now
Me too, especially when it's still the middle of the day.	I hate when I am tired.
Oh yes, you're right. I'm in the same boat right now!	or in the case here, morning
I think I am missing something, you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???	i ate 3 pizzas just earlier and i feel so good and relaxed now, almost tranquility
It's definitely some kind of anomaly.	yeah i know right, a lot, and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok, But i totally do feel great .
What did you eat there?	Sometime ago I was really hungry and decided to treat myself to some well reviewed restaurant, well it was all I hoped for.
ooooh onion soup sounds really good, onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish	Onion soup with croutons.
I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do?	i was extremely disgusted when a close friend of mine threw up on my baby. he was really drunk at a party we were at
Idk beat him up, lol. throw a drink at him, the sky is the limit!	what else can i do? i washed my kid clean and got the hell out of there
cool, how did it come by?	I just finished making my bulletin board at work.
if you put so much work into it, im sure they will	I'm happy with it. Hopefully my students like it too.
I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?	i was so angry when i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me.. dont know how i can forgive her
Wow. I hope that you can work it out, but I would understand why you wouldn't want to.	3 years
really? well, who doesnt!	I really feel nostalgic around christmas
i actually feel like a kid even now during christmas	true.. there is something about that holiday that makes us wanna be kids again
wow, what was it?	my dad gave me the greatest gift ever on my graduation
woohoo! you are one lucky child!	a brand new ford car, i was thrilled
No way! I just moved from NY to FL. You are going to love NY tho, its an awesome state. Congrats on the job!	i felt really good about my change to new york after getting a job
Oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city. I was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like Idaho where I lived in NY. :p	thank you so much.. i moved from Idaho.. so this is very new to me, all this
I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up?	i felt heartbroken when my girlfriend moved away without telling me first
That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved. :/	we had a fight, i never knew we were broken up though
What incident was that ?	hi there it was a hard day when this incident occured.
what happened then ?	i was driving home and it started to rain
"I know what you mean, it sucks when those ""dates"" linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that! "	my dad passed away around the time of christmas.. it always casts a shadow over my holidays
"Its not time to get over it, you arent doing any wrong its okay to ""feel"" things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love! "	yeah.. i know it is time to get over it. but certain memories are so haunting
i understand what you are saying, pets are always close to our hearts	i feel like my dog is my child time after another.. love him so much
yeah, i have 2 german shepards	very true, do you have any pets?
is it a scary movie?	i was shaking when i was watching conjuring in the movies
no i never heard of it	it is a terrifying movie. havent you seen it yet?
yea thats probably the best choice to make	yesterday i was so angry at my parents.. but i kept my mouth shut and came away. i cant hurt them, i feel so faithful
i can understand that	i always think all those hard times they had bringing me up
Yuck, that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?	some guy threw up on the street last night right before me.. i was grossed out
I'm sure you did. Guess he couldn't make it to the trash can.	i got the hell out of there right away!
oh thats really sweet!	I saw some pictures recently of when my family and I went on vacation when I was little.
oh no.. i hope you feel better	Yeah, it made me sad to see it because they I live so far away now.
Those are great aren'	i love thinking about fond memories with my family
Sorry(Those are great aren't they?) I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated :)	do you have a large family?
wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle	My roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog.  My dog is really nice and doesn't really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house.  Lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls/barks.  However, there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement.  I have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately.
i can understand that	I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything.
Do you think it was the right decision?	I got a job offer at another company that pays more, but I turned them down because I've been with my current company for ten years.
That's great. Maybe you will get a raise too	Definitely, my company always treat's me right. They haven't gave me a reason to want to leave.
why is that	i felt shy when i dropped my groceries in the parking lot
oh i can understand that	because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up
That must have been terrifying	The other day an intruder broke into my home. I had to hide in the closet while I called the cops.
I don't know what I would have done	It was, the whole time I was shaking and breathing heavily.
Awesome! What kind of dog is Lola?	My dog Lola won first place in the dog show. That's my girl!
I don't think I would have been able to stop smiling either! That is so awesome!	She's a Pekingese. When they handed me the trophy I just couldn't stop smiling. She's the best dog I could ask for.
That's nice, is she technologically savvy?	i was happy this morning when i received an email from my grandma
Well it's nice she's making the effort!	not really but she tries haha
I do too. I have a box filled with them. How old is your oldest?	i love reading old letters from family members
wow!	i have some old ones from the korean war
That's good. Now you don't have to worry about it.	I have everything ready for back to school supplies for my son to start school.
Wow, your son is lucky to have a parent who is on top of things!	That is true! I also have his outfit picked out for the first day of school.
What did you bet?	I bet my cousin that I could beat him at a game of basketball. He's horrible at playing so I knew I could beat him.
That would be awesome! Did your cousin pay you?	I bet him $1000 because that's how good I am. I had no doubt in my mind I could win. I ended up obliterating him and taking his shoes too.
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope she is okay.	i was sad to hear my mom is in the ER again
I am so sorry. I hope she is able to get some relief and rest.	me too, she has heart problems unfortunately
Oh man! That must have been great to hear! What did he say?	My son said his first word the other day. My little man is going to be smart just like his pop's.
That's so funny! That's one of those things you will definitely remember forever!	He said poop. When I heard It I jumped up with joy. That's my boy!
Oh I can understand that! I would also like to be outside; it looks like such a beautiful day! At least it is almost the weekend!	im envious of my friends who are at the park right now while im stuck inside
That's great! Are you going to join your friends at the park?	thats true, i'll be outside in an hour or less!
You should have taken a flashlight just in case.	I was walking through a trail to get to my house last night and it was pitch black. I was afraid a bear or something might get me lol
hey at least you got a nice workout in!	I was gonna use my phone but it died, so I just sprinted for like half an hour.
That is true. Well I'm glad you made it home safely. Maybe next time maybe go a little earlier before it gets so dark out.	Yeah way to look at it positive lol. There was a river nearby so at least it sounded kind of relaxing.
I had ice cream too! Sorry you got sick	i felt sick after eating too much ice cream last night
Ha, at least it was good	its my own fault i went past my limit lol
Thats always fun! Does your pup do well with other dogs?	I took my pup to the park last weekend and he had fun meeting other dogs and their owners!
Mine does the same thing. Goldens are so adorable.	Yeah he is a golden so he is happy no matter what lol. He will go up to people and not leave until they pet him.
He is just a mix breed. We really don't even know.	Absolutely! What kind of dog do you have?
lol, it happens to us all	So I was drunk coming back from a party and woke up to find I peed the bed lol. First time in like 24 years.
haha true	Yea you cant help but feel like a stupid little kid or something, at least I did lol.
That sucks did you need to return something?	i felt dumb when I lost my receipt
That stuff is pretty expensive. Maybe you can sell it on eBay or something.	yes some printer ink
Oh wow! I would have been so disgusted and outraged! What did you do?	So I was on the bus back from a party and a drunk guy barfed on me at a stop lol. Most of it got on my jacket and he didnt even apologize.
That must have been a terrible experience. I'm not sure that I would be able to wear that jacket again.	Well I didn't want to start a fight or anything, so I just took it off and held my nose the rest of the ride. Then I washed it like 6 times lol
i hope you do really well	I can't wait for college in the fall! I left 2 years ago and am back feeling more confident in my studying abilities.
going to see some old friends this weekend	Thanks anything youre looking forward to?
Good job what did you work hard on?	i was happy with myself for working hard this week
Nice keep it up!	my job and at the gym
That is awesome!  What are you studying	I got back into college after 2 years off and I'm pretty proud of myself.
was it hard to go back or are you enjoying it?	Ya thanks it's mechanical engineering I have 2 years left.
Well good luck!  I am sure you will do great!	Oh I am going back in a few weeks. It will probably be hard but I will enjoy it for sure.
I do like the rain though	So last weekend it poured rain all day and I chilled at my house by myself. Pretty boring.
I am sure you will have plans again	It is relaxing, the only thing is that you can't do anything outside really. Had some plans but they got canceled.
Yeah, I am sure it will be fine	That's true, it's good to look forward to the future.
I would have been to. I always wonder how people make the money necessary to buy vehicles like that.	I saw a dude driving a Porsche down the street of my city. Was definitely jealous lol
Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous, and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine).	Yeah I am thinking this guy must be a CEO or something. If I had the money I would buy one for sure.
I take you don't have issued with you weight.	Yesterday, I ate a whole pizza by myself!
Ok, then.If it was a 1 thing only, no problem.	No, I just did it because nobody thought I could.
Is he acting creepy at all?	This guy at school keeps following me around. He followed me all day yesterday. I think he want's to be my friend.
Have you tried to talk to him at all and see what his deal is?	It's getting to that point. I wish he would just stop. I have enough friends already.
That's good you have well-behaved dogs, did you train them?	Im proud of my dogs behaing around new visitors
Well it's good you're doing something right.	Not on purpose, but they have learned from right and wrong from me
Oh no! What did you do to bring yourself down? (from the panic attack)	The other day I went on a airplane and had a panic attack the whole time. I'm not good with heights.
I'm sorry. That sounds bad. Flying always makes me nervous but I usually make it ok.	I had to cover my head with a blanket, and picture myself somewhere else. That's how bad it was.
Well we are friends aren't we? I do appreciate you as one.	I don't have a lot of friends.
You wanna maybe go to the bar with my other friends this weekend? They will probably like you. Tim likes some things you do.	Thanks. In my mom's group, I feel like a lot of the moms are friends but I'm not friends with any of them.
Oh i hate it when i get those kind of thoughts but eventually you recover and don't think about it.	I was in a small fender bender earlier this week. Now I am scared that I will be in an even worse wreck.
Just relax more you got this and it was just a fender bender.	I hope so. I am driving and I just get so scared.
Naptime is a good thing though isnt it	I took my son out and did a bunch of nice stuff for him.  He was great until we got to naptime.
Well that is never good	It is but he threw a huge temper tantrum at naptime.
That doesnt sound too fun	For mother's day, my son had to fill out a paper in school that asked a bunch of questions.
Oh wow, the kid is a snitch	I read it when he got home and alot of his responses involved mommy said a bad word!
It happens, everyone does it	i was upset i woke up so late today
I am sure you will fix it	yeah thats true, not the end of the world;
Have you spoken to him about it?	i am annoyed at my neighbor's loud lawnmower
Are you going to do anything about it in the future?	nope its happening right now
congratulations im glad, hopefully you will like it more than your last job	I was able to find a new job after being fired
im glad to hear that	It turned out to be better than my last one for the most part
what kind of pizza?	I went to a restaurant and ordered some pizza
what!! i hope u got your money back	Bacon and sausage pizza.  Unfortunately, it also had a cockroach crawling across it when I picked it up
Why's that?	i was nervous about my car overheating
Did your car end up overheating?	it was over 100 degrees outside and i was low on antifreeze
Thats great! But what did they do that you didn't like?	A supervisor I didn't like got fired
Well looks like that didn't work out for him in the end. What finally got him axed?	He and I never got along, seemed like he tried to sabotage me
Did you replace it?	i felt upset about losing my friend's blu ray i borrowed
Do you think he'll get angry?	not yet im still looking for it
did you start walking faster?	I was walking down the sidewalk at night and thought I saw someone following me
hopefully you made it out safely	Yeah, tried to get out of there
That is good to hear. What happened that made you think so?	My neighbors really look out for each other
Oh ok. That sounds like they really get along well. It is nice to have good neighbors.	They always holding hands and smiling
Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope it was nothing serious!	i was worried when I heard my friend was in the hospital
That's good to know!  You all have a lot to be thankful for!	no he has already been released thankfully
I would hope so too or else the relationship would be awkward.	I loaned my neighbor some money. Hopefully he pays it back today
I hope it wasn't too much money just in case.	Yes thats true, to say the least
What you you have planned?	im getting stoked for the weekend
Really?? It sounds like there was something going on.	nothing! thats why im excited lol
Oh that's never a good situation. It happens to the best of us though. I need to clean my fridge	I cleaned the refridgerator out the other day and I found something that had gone very very bad.
I'm sure they were thinking waste not, want not. haha	I put it off too long this time. It was pretty stinky, my dogs thought I was nuts for throwing food away.
Oh yeah? Find anything interesting?	I was reading through some old school papers
Ah, nothing quite like that feeling. I remember when I was on the school newspaper. Good times.	It made me think about how far I've come since.  I also felt like I was in a different time and place reading them
Are you going, too?	My friends went out to a party
Oh no, that sucks. Would you have wanted to go though?	They didn't invite me for some reason
Well, that's not cool.	My roommate left a bunch of dishes in the kitchen
Does he do that stuff often?	I wish he'd pick up after himself
Oh? What kind of project?	I was busy with a work related project
Oh that's nice of them!	Presentation, a co-worker came in and helped me out
That's good, do you get paid over time?	I put in extra hours at work
I think if you keep it up you'll get the recognition you want soon.	Yeah, I would like for my boss to notice and promote me at some point
Was everything okay? What were they doing?	I was taking a stroll at night and saw a group of guys up ahead
True, you never know these days.	I ended up turning around, who knows what they were up to
Is your phone waterproof?	I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet
You are so lucky! My phone would have been done...	My case was, as the phone still worked
That's great! Are you seeing results?	I've been consistently working out the past few weeks
I bought a spin bike but I haven't used it yet	Absolutely, I feel so much better too
Maybe they were left for you.	I took some cookies my roommate left out in the open
He can't save them out in the open. What kind were they?	I think he meant to save them
Did he get it back? I hate it when that happens...	A friend forgot his phone at the library
You are a true friend indeed. I bet he is very appreciative!	I went back and grabbed it for him
Did he eventually find one?	A friend of mine was having a hard time finding a job
That is making progress.	After months of work, he at least got an interview
Congratulations!  What do you plan on doing?	I recently graduated college, I'm so glad I finally got it done!
That is a great goal to set for yourself.	Next stop is hopefully pharmacy school. Okay, maybe not completely done.
I am sorry to hear that. I hope the results will be good.	I recently spent a couple of restless days awaiting the results of a skin biopsy.  I had a weird mole come up out of nowhere.
It is good new.	I got them back yesterday, and it was good news.  No cancer!
Was it an intruder?	Awhile back, our whole household was awoken by someone kicking hard at our front door.
What a surprise haha	No, it was my drunk cousin, lol.  She had tried knocking and we didn't hear her.
I did too. Did you go out last night?	i was upset i woke up so late today
Well I stayed up late too. Drinking beer and playing vidos games lol	nope lol i just stayed up late
Holy goodness! That's so cool. What will you do there?	I got hired for my dream job at apple! I can't wait to start!
Oh my god! That's something to be proud of, congrats!	I will help design the new iphones. It's going to be so much fun!
I am sorry you are feeling like this.  Maybe you should reach out to someone	Yesterday was my day off and I spent the whole day in bed looking at the ceiling. My friends and family didn't even call or check up on me.
I am sorry that you are going through this	It's like they only call me when they need something. The only friend I have is myself.
Oh wow, now that's funny! I've only been on one roller coaster and it was rather small, but I loved it!	The other day I got on a roller coaster for the first time, and I almost pooped my pants because we were so high up.
Oh wow! I'd love to go on a much larger coaster than the one I road. But it might be scarier than I imagine.	This roller coaster was one of the biggest in the world and i'm not good with heights.
How old is he?	i couldnt believe how good my nephew is at little league
They are still cute at this age and they make a lot of progress.	8!
Oh no! Well hopefully she wasn't too upset, then you'll know how her character is :)	The other day I was on a date with a beautiful women and I accidentally spilled wine on her dress.
Oh no! Well, honestly if she can't deal with one mistake, then it's no good anyhow. But maybe it was something else. Sometimes people just don't click.	She hasn't returned any of my calls. I feel horrible.
I feel you! I don't like to perform in front of people either. Did you decline?	Yesterday was my first time at a karaoke bar. I started to get all tense when my friends kept telling my I should go on stage to perform.
Oh you can be as bad as you want there, it just matters if you're having fun :)	No, I ended up going through with it. I was worried that they would boo me at first because my singing is horrible, but I guess everyone was too drunk to care.
Wow , i bet it was a long day of moving, but i can imagine the joy you must feel inside you, congratulations !!!!	I finally purchased the house of my dreams. We barley finished moving in yesterday.
I used to move furniture for my old job, so i bet it was a lot of heavy lifting, its so exciting to finally have your own place	Thanks. I did it all by myself too. All that saving finally paid off!
I hope you do! What is the test on?	i feel i will do well on my test next week
Oh man. That was a difficult subject for me after Physics. Are you a science major?	chemistry!
I understand how lonely it can be when your schedule doesn't fit with your old friends.	im envious that my friends are off work all weekend
You can make new friends. Its just part of the human experience. Everything is temporary	yeah true but i cant blame them
Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that!	i recently lost my dog, he died.  i had him for 12 years.
Dogs are with us for such a short amount of time. Kinda wish they lived as long as us.	thank you. he was the sweetest thing.
Friends can be so awesome!	i appreciated all the help i got from my friends last week
What did they help you with?	i definitely agree

War would be terrifying. What makes you think we will?	im scared that we will go to war soon
Yea. Seems to be more of that lately.	just general unrest and instability globally

Do you honk at them?	just generally driving poorly and not using signals
Wow. He must be really strong! Why'd he lift the car?	i saw a guy lift a car, he was so strong

Family time is so precious. Are your kids still with you?	i used to take my children to disney world when they were young, we always had a great time.
They grow up so fast sometimes.	no they are grown.  they are in their twenties now, i miss them.
I'm so sorry to hear that!	i was fired from my job.
Did they say why?	i was crushed, didn't even see it coming.
Why do you say that?	sometimes i wish i could go back to being a teenager
Yea, I totally get ya on that.	it was so much easier then.  no responsibilities.
Man, are you me? People been annoying lately?	sometimes i just wish i could be a hermit and never deal with people
Here I was hoping a Walmart would open in my area. Guess it's a good thing there isn't one.	Yes!! Try to walk through walmart, people are so rude!
Oh which Disney? Sounds exciting!	i am so excited i get to go to disney in october!
What's your favorite thing to do there?	disney world! this will be my 6th time.
That would make me so mad!  What did you do?	some one ran into my car and drove off
Yeah, It bothers me when people don't take responsibility for their actions.	i called the police and my insurance company.  people just have no respect.
Lol. Why didn't she tell you?	Went on a first date last night. I had chocolate from the appetizer in my beard the entire time.
So you're not gonna see her again?	I don't know. She was strange. I did not notice until I went to the restroom right before I left.
Gotta have brains	She text me today but I'm not interested. She was beautiful but not very smart at all.
Why did you stop?	It's been over a year since my last cup of coffee. Today was the day I taste the sweet juice of the god's again.
Wow. I drink Dr Pepper like coffee.	To show my self I had self control. I was drinking like 5 cups a day.
I bet. I get that feeling every morning with a Dr Pepper	Today as soon as my lips touched the cup. I felt my soul smile.
Why would you have twenty dollars on the desk	So I have a private office at work. Someone broke in the morning and stole $20 off my desk.
OH. Thats terrible.	For the vending machine at lunch. I lock my wallet up took 20 out put on my desk. Had to run to the bathroom. Came back and it was gone. I share my office with no one.
Tots?	Got a fresh cut today. My hair is on Fleak. Tots I'm beautiful.
Congratulations on your hair.	totally
where is that	Wondering around an 800 year old city, I can't help myself but to enjoy it's architecture and atmosphere.
oh id love to visit there one day when its a more stable area	I've been there sometime age, it's in Ukraine, Kiev.
I know! It's almost an unexplainable feeling isn't it?	I never thought I could love someone as much as my little baby girl.
But it is also the best feeling ever! Enjoy every moment!	Yes, It is so hard to describe honestly!
Best advice I ever got was that housework can wait and take naps whenever you cam when the baby sleeps!	Thank you! It is hard at times tho when getting little sleep.
What did you almost buy?	Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing!
Ah, yea, I've had the once or twice. When you buy used you have to go in with the mindset of haggle down, find a decent one, or leave	I saw this great used car in a print ad, and went to the dealership, but when I got there, it was all ratty and crappy looking!
I love heavy rain, it just really soothes me.	For some reason heavy rain at night brings up some good memories for me.
I know! Also the thunder is so cool to listen to.	Yes, the sound that it makes when the windows are open...
I did a research on a cancer vaccine	I wasn't feeling right a few days ago, but I guess I'm alright now.
Oh sorry for the mix up	Well I meant my mood, not my health in general.
What happened to you?	As I was people watching today I suddenly felt very happy.
OK. I hope you are now fine?	That's a thing, nothing really, I guess I just relaxed for a bit.
Never. I hate cats personally	Have you ever wish to switch places with your cat for a day or two?
I've come to hate them too unfortunately. Constant noise	How about, dogs?
Oh, that's so sad. What earthquake?	After the earthquake  I visited the old capitol, and saw still intact temples.
Oh, that's a big one. I bet it caused a lot of damage	It was a 8.6 I believe, but it happened like 2 years ago.
Aw that's so sad! Did you help it?	I watched a stray dog yesterday that had a lot of tick, I felt bad for her.
I guess that's fair, but I probably would've taken it to the vet.	I didn't, I don't know why, maybe because I hate ticks.
Me neither. It's why I hate living in London	For some reason I never liked cloudy weather.
Nope. We just remain miserable year round	Oh I don't know how you guys do it, you must have artificial sun at home?
Music can be so touching to the soul.	I was listening to a guitar play the other day, and it made me cry a little.
Who was the artist of the song?	Yes, especially when you don't expect it to be.
I like incense. Did you find the cause of the bad odor?	I had to get some incense few days ago, because my room smelled bad.
Oh well I hope you can fix it soon	Yes, it some plumbing problems.
What made you realize that? You can't live in fear	I realized a while ago, that it is good if you are not afraid of fear.
It's good to face your fears	Yes, but if you don't run away from it, there wont be any fear.
Oh was it a bad or naughty thought?	I had some thought come into my mind, and they turned me red.
What was it? Was it really that crazy?	It was a crazy though actually, but thank god I didn't act on it.
I think that happen in a lot of families.	We grew up fighting a lot with my sibling, but I still love them.
I understand. You were the only one getting hit?	Yes, you are right, but we still need to forgive.
ooh my God he hurt himself	I was really pissed off when my brother ran my new car into a tree last month
so bad i can imagine that loose he made to you	Thankfully he did not. The tree was uprooted and the car really got damaged as well.
how was it ?	I was terrified when i watched the new conjuring movie!
wow i can only imagine	It was really scary!
thats a good thought to have	I would like to believe our country would come together sooner or later
i totally agree with that	Yeah, i mean.. We are all the children of the same nation.. time to stop the fight.
oh nice	My granny walked in on me and my girlfriend the other day
wait til she leaves and continue	It was really awkward though.. i mean,what do you do at that moment!
Sounds like an interesting job.  I'm sure it's taxing on the family though.	I often am gone from my home and family for days or even weeks at a time.  I work on remote locations, looking for oil and gas.
In the end is the trade off worth it?	It is difficult feeling isolated.  I miss them a lot.
I am so jealous. He is one of my all time favorite actors.	I saw robert downey jr the other day.. such an awesome experience
Were you star struck?	He is so charming and electrifying in person as well.. such a nice guy
Oh no.. what did you do?	So get this, my friend once threw up on me after getting drunk
I would have done the same as well	i was grossed out! i rushed off there immediately
Oh no.. I'm sure you did not feel great when you found out	My phone company was billing me for stuff i did not use
I would be too. Hopefully that gets resolved soon	I was extremely irritated actually
That is exactly the way you are supposed to feel. Did you get the job?	I felt really good about myself when i stepped in for my interview last week
Good for you! Congrats buddy	Yeah, i got it!
oh yea congrats.. what will you be doing	I just got a new job at the local firm
that sounds like a good career	I will be handling the sales section of the firm. So excited about the future
thats really cool. How did he react?	I recently found out that my old long lost friend works at my new firm
This is such an awesome coincidence buddy	It is a girl actually, and she was really surprised as well.
Oh yeah, i hear that it is really scary	I was so afraid when i was watching the new conjuring movie
Oh no.. But it gave you such a memorable experience as well, right?	It was. And i went at night, alone. Was such a bad idea
Oh so sorry to hear that.. what did you do?	I was so angry when our mail service lost a job invitation for me
I hear you.. dont worry, things will be ok soon enough	I lodged a compliant. But a missed chance is missed itself
I am sorry to hear that.  You weren't hurt were you?	A few weeks ago I got in my first real car accident.
Were you at fault?	I'm mostly okay. Just a little whiplash. I've never been in more than a fender bender before, so it was not a fun experience.
aww.. that is so sweet.. i bet every parent feel that way	I always get a sense of pride watching my children
oh no.. i feel sorry for you buddyt	true. i feel like they are my parents who were born as my kids
Oh wow. is it really as scary as the reviews say it is?	I went to see the new conjuring movie in the theater.. it was such a terrifying experience
Damn, sounds like such a stunning experience	that and much more! Especially if you choose to go and watch it alone at night
I can image, that's pretty disgusting.  What your friend sick or drunk?	I was so grossed out when a friend threw up on me
You can only do so much.  Next time I'd just let him drink on his own.	he was drunk out of his mind on whiskey.. i told him to cut back many times.. of well..
Oh lord.. How did it happen?	I was so grossed out when a friend of mine threw up on me
God.. That is really disgusting, yes	We were at a party, he drank way too much and did it.
That sucks.  How long have you been a teacher for?	The school year starts again soon, which means I have to start working again.
Yeah I'd imagine.  The months off for summer is nice though.	This will be my 4th year. I love it, but the beginning of the year is always pretty hectic.
Why would you do that?	I gave my credit card for a stranger to use once
So, why didn't you just pay for them your self?	I felt sorry for the person, she looked trustworthy. and she needed to pay for some medicines for a friend who had accident
Sorry to hear that.. Why were you alone?	i felt so lonely in my new apartment
I hear you.. Socialize, get new friends.. You will start adapting	I have just moved away from my family to a new city for work. so.
Oh dear lord.. Was he sick or something?	My friend threw up on my face once
haha.. Sorry, i couldn't help but picturize it.	he was drunk actually, a lot
Oh no, what happened?	Well, not too bad. I felt really nervous the other day though.
Holy.. What did they want?	The cops pulled me over, i thought something was wrong
I see.. Any specific reason for that?	I wanted set all the ingredients at the cooking table before i cook last night
It is really good to have that level of discipline	I just like to be prepared and organized. Thats me.
Same here.  It helps make cooking go smoother.	I want the ingredients all on my table before i cook
Agreed.  No sense wasting time while cooking by looking for odds and ends.	There is something so nice about being prepared fully
i bet you did.. Felt nostalgic huh?	I thought about my childhood when i went to a comic book store earlier
that is really innocent and sweet of you my friend	haha.. yeah. So much childhood packed into a room
Aww.. Did you used to go as a family to the beach?	I felt like i am with my family again when i went to the beach couple days ago
Such a sweet story.. So happy just to hear that from you	Yeah.. We took off on the car, all our family and we used to make a whole day out of it
WOW!! She is my absolute favorite!	I was in awe to see the beauty of Angelina jolie. met her at a restaurant recently
So true.  I was so jealous of brad pitt over the years	Mine too. She is a timeless beauty
Aw.. sorry about that my friend. Have you made any friends?	I felt really alone in Miami when i moved there first
So true.. family is everything!	A few. I had moved away from my family for a job. Can't ever replace them, right?
Oh no, what did he do?	I got so mad when i saw my brother ruining my favorite dress
Aww, you got to admit that is so cute as well	He cut animal shapes into it. When we were kids
That is really sweet my friend. It is nice to see old friends	i was so happy to see my high school friends at our reunion
Aw, i am missing my high school now that you said it	True! All those old memories started rushing in
Haha. Do you love sports cars that much?	I feel such envy when i see guys with sports cars
Such passion for cars. Wish you can buy one soon mate	Oh yeah.. I collected pictures of all the sports cars out there as a child, growing up
How much better did it pay?	A competing firm offered me a job for higher salary, if i cheated my firm. But i respectfully declined
That is not too much, I think you made a good choice	5k. But i am satisfied with my current firm
Sorry to hear that my friend. Why did you move?	I felt so lonely in Miami when i moved there from my family
I see.. Dont worry, you will own your new city soon enough	I got a new job in here, so.
I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?	I felt so alone in my new city
I am sorry to hear that, why did you move there?	thanks, you too
Did you end up buying anything?	I felt so happy when i went to a comic book store the other day, felt like i was a child again
Well is it close to where you live? That would be cool to go back often	yeah, i bought quite a lot stuff
that is a good tactic actually, it boosts your confidence	I always make sure to self assure myself before i go for an interview
Very true. We should believe in ourselves for others to do that	Yeah, and confidence is key in winning those right
Oh my god, sorry to hear that my friend.. Were you guys close?	I was so terribly sad when my granny passed away..
How sad.. Find peace knowing that she is in heaven now	Yeah, very much. She was the one who looked after me.
what did she get sick off , im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife	My wife was sick all last week, so I had to stick by her side.
When i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one	She caught a very bad cold. I brought her soup everyday and tended to her every need.
That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?	I gave a long, drawn out presentation at school the other day. I found the task to be very daunting.
Me, too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now, right?	Horrible, my palms were sweaty the entire time. I hate talking in front of large crowds.
Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.	My friend got accepted into Harvard University. That's my dream school. I don't understand how someone as dumb as him can get accepted there, and i'm stuck at community college.
Yep, that's the way of the world, especially with Universities to.	That's what i'm thinking, it's not what you know it's who you know.
A duplicate? Like a fake?	i recently ordered earphones online but i receive duplicate product
That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.	yes i received a fake product , the make of earphones is very well known brand
Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?	I had the worst day ever yesterday.  I had just finished a long, hard day at work, I had driven the 40 minutes home, was just driving into my street and realised that I had left my bag with phone, purse and most importantly my house keys back in the office!
Ah yes, a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still, what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day.	Well I wanted to cry and scream, I was so cross with myself but unfortunately as I live alone I just had to drive the 40 minutes back to the office to get them then another 40mins back home.  Where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol.
I would be so lost without my phone, but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though!	Exactly, so irritating.  But hey you live and learn, I guarantee you I will never leave work again without double then triple checking that I have all my belongings with me!
Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?	I was shocked to see $200.00 included with the card.
So, it was your partner who used you card	No not at all, She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday.
Oh no! Was anyone hurt?	one month back i went for a wildlife safari , where i was attacked by a wild boar
That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?	ya i had bruises on my leg
Are you willing to go on another safari?	it attacked me and ran into the bushes . it was a very bad experience.
I'm not surprised.	no i am done with such trips.
That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.	My husbands brother was getting married.  I searched online and in every shop to find the perfect dress.  I finally found it, tried it on and loved it.  I couldnt buy it until the following week as I had to wait to payday so I left it over in the store.  The next day my sister in law called in.  She had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress.  She took it out of the bag to show me and I discovered it was the same dress!! Couldnt believe it.  Oh how I resented her at that moment.
That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.	Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.  Needless to say I got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day...
You are telling me you are a hoarder?	I never can get myself to give away their baby items.
Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine	lol no I just can't part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect.
Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.	I was walking down the street yesterday in my brand new summer dress.  I though i was gorgeous! Suddenly a big gust of wind came and blew my dress up around my ears! Where I succeeded in flashing my underwear to the entire street.  Oh the embarrassment.
I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though	Oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately I got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all.  I was so mortified I just ran home.  Later though I chatted about it with my friends and was finally able to laugh about it.
That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.	I so get how you feel because I decided to watch Insidious the other night on my own.  I scared the life out of myself afterwards because I thought I kept seeing shadows and hearing noises and had myself convinced someone or something was in the house with me!
Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.	Oh no just my vivid imagination lol.  I do love a good horror but usually I watch them with my husband.  I am clearly not as brave on my own!!
That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.	I helped a doctor's assistant over a couple of months
That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.	It was she wasn't really good ans i had no problem helping
I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.	my car had a small accident recently
Do you have full cover?	no it was a minor accident , but car got damaged little
Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?	I never did find out why there were so many police cars there today.
Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.	In town, I had my kids with me to buy school supplies.
Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?	I found my old high school yearbooks that other day.
Yeah, we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.	I think that I didn't appreciate not having to worry about adult stuff back then!
That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!	I am feel pretty mucky things have been pretty stable at home.
Cherish this time you have, because you never know when it could change!	Yes I am and thankful since I have 3 young kids at home,
What restaurant is it for?	I got a gift card to a restaurant I've been wanting to try for a long time.
Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.	It's a local non-chain Greek restaurant. It's fancy and supposed to be very good.
That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?	I went on a blind date last week. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect at first.
Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.	It was alright, but it was hard to find common ground at first.
Oh no, I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?	I have a dentist appointment tomorrow. I think I have a cavity.
Dang, that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that	Yes, but I think I'm genetically hosed when it comes to teeth. I really hate it.
Wow, you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!	My son scored a perfect 1600 on the SATs!!
Geniuses don't do chores my friend.	I am proud. And he may eventually cure cancer, but I'd settle right now for him cleaning his room!
I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it, though.	I went to my moms funeral yesterday, but surprisingly I wasn't sad at all. I was at peace because she accomplished a lot during her time here on earth.
But a part of her is still here in you.	Yeah, she's in a better place now.
They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...	My husband and sons left town for weekend.
I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence	Yeah, it was cool for a while, but the house is way to quiet now
Whoever ate it all is evil!!!	So, I bought myself a box strawberry frosted pop tarts last week. Today I went to go have one for breakfast...GONE!
I know right. I would be so furious!	I need to interrogate everyone in this house. I'm so angry. You don't mess with Mom's Pop Tarts!
I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.	My neighbor was having a party last night and wouldn't let me sleep. I felt like going out there and giving him a piece of my mind!
Yeah, something should be done about it!	No, next time I might snap. They never show any consideration for anybody on the block. They do whatever they want.
I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!	My friend wanted to go to lunch today. I told her I was busy, but really I just didn't want to go...
Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!	Well, I do feel a little guilty, just sitting here on my couch watching tv
Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?	So...the sewer line backed up into our house last week.
What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?	It was truly disgusting. We had to have a crew of plumbers come in and dig up our yard.
That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier, him or you?	My brother got out of prison yesterday! It felt so good to see him after such a long time.
He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!	Definitely me, I gave him a big bear hug when he walked out those gates.
Ugh, I hate when unexpected expenses arise.	The transmission in my car died last week. Such an expensive repair
Well, that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.	Fortunately, my parents offered to loan me the money to fix it.
Wow, great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!	My friend and I both did a low-carb diet last month. She lost 8 pounds. I gained 2!
Well, keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.	I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious.
Please tell me you won a lot of money.	On a whim today, I bought a scratch off card at 7/11
lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.	Not a lot - $100. But that's $100 more than I had when I woke up this morning. I was so surprised I did one of those annoying girly squeals at the check out counter
OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?	My kids spilled juice on my brand new white carpet. I told them not to brink food, or drinks in the living room. When will they learn?
Hopefully they remember	Yes, but I had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed. I gave them a spanking that they will never forget. I'm not putting up with this no more.
Did you brush it right out?	I had a salad for lunch yesterday, then went shopping at the mall. When I got home around 7pm I discovered I had a HUGE piece of spinach between my front teeth!
Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?	I did. But dozen of people had already seen it. I was mortified. No one told me!
You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!	My friend invited me to a pool party, but I don't know how to swim. I told her I would think about it.
Yea, and you can bring some water toys to play with!	I'm not sure, I might just stay in the shallow part of the pool.
Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?	I went to a wedding this weekend. I've recently lost a ton of weight so I bought a new dress for the occassion.
How much total weight did you lose, and how long did it take?	Yes. I've wanted to be healthier, but I also wanted to look hot and feel confident at this event.
Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?	I'm leaving for vacation on Wednesday!
Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds	On a cruise to Havana. I'm so excited!
Aww man, I hope you brought your raincoat.	I got caught in a huge rainstorm last week. It was a deludge.
That's good, you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold.	Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house.
That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!	My brother in the army showed up at my football event yesterday. I wasn't expecting him to come. I thought he was still stationed in Iraq.
Did you get a video of it?	Totally, I was in shock.
Gee, he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!	Once, at a Waffle House near Memphis, I heard a man order 15 eggs over-easy.
Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is.	I stayed to watch to see if he'd eat them all. He did. I was very impressed.
Oh dang, that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far, it must've been super embarrassing.	TSA made me pull down my pants in front of everybody at the airport yesterday. They thought I was a bomb threat.
Dude, you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.	Yeah, I will never show my face there again.
Oh yeah, what was it called? I really love roller coasters!	I rode the largest roller coaster I've ever ridden this summer.
I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!	Millenium Force, in Cedar Point. It was utterly terrifying.
Oh, I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.	I'm waiting to hear back from a few colleges about scholarships.
All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.	Yes, I think my stats are good. I'm hopeful there will be some good news soon.
That's awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?	My best friend is getting married next weekend. I'm in the wedding.
Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!	Super excited! These two have been together forever. It's about time they made it legit!
Wow, that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?	I went to a fancy art showing at a gallery last night.
Gee, she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!	It was watercolors. My neighbor was the artist. I had no idea she did such great work. She also has two toddlers. I have no idea how she manages all of that.
Did you feel very emasculated by this?	I thought I could lift, but my wife upstaged me by benching 150 lbs at the gym the other day. I can only lift 130 lbs.
Yeah, I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!	No, it actually turned me on. I didn't know she was that strong.
I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?	My son came back from a camping trip last night. I was great to have him safely home again.
My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!	He did. I'm a worrier, but I need to learn to let go more.
Oh wow, I bet the emotions of that came back to you.	I came across my wedding albums the other day and showed them to my kids.
Yes, those memories are what make life so special.	Yes, it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband, pre-kids. Very sentimental.
So, not a surprise, but still nice to get?	I got a car for my birthday, but I kinda knew I was going to get it beforehand because I kept telling my wife I wanted it.
That's sweet.	Yeah, kind of ruined the surprise, but I can always count on my wife to make me feel special.
301	250
301	250
Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.	i miss my childhood and living with my parents
That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.	yes indeed.  i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me.  i would live in it.
Oh yeah, why is that?	i live next to a football field and every football season i hate living here
I would have them towed!	Because they park in my driveway!
Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?	i have signs up this year, so i can do that legally!
Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.	Yes. Which i think is wrong.  If they are on my property i should have the right without the sign.
That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?	my husband treated me to a week at disney, i had no idea!
Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!	disney world. it's the only one Ive ever been to .
That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?	i am pretty happy right now, i don't think i have ever been happier with my life.
You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy.	Exactly! I used to struggle but i don't anymore
that's great that you can trust her.  how old?	My daughter went out of town, but she promised me she wouldn't do anything I wouldn't approve of, and I believe her, so I let her go.
That's great. Be thankful, some people aren't so lucky.	Yeah, she's a good kid and hasn't given me any reason to think otherwise. She just turned 18.
what did you almost buy?	Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing at Walmart!
It's hard to find good quality at walmart	It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad, but when I got there, it looked cheap and shabby!
I would try target.  good quality stuff there.	I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else, right?
try googling it, and read thru the reviews	I could try online, but I'd have to buy it first and then see if it's good quality.
Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?	i am trying to sell my house, i hope i can find a buyer
Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate, right?  Location, Location, Location.	I hope i do.  We will see, I know it can take a while.\
Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then	yes i live behind a school.
You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?	yes, but i will leave that to the listing agent.
Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?	I had to leave my last job because this manager they brought in was such an incompetent doofus.
Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now, with a manager who cares.	"He was the ""marketing manager"" but couldn't market his way out of a paper bag, it was impossible to work with him. Plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse."
Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?	i am concerned about my father
Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age.	he is old, and he lives alone.  i just worry because he is getting old.  he gets on ok, but i don't know how much longer.
We can surely hope!	no it's not, but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day.
That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?	My neighbor asked me to watch over his dog. I told him he could trust me, but he escaped and ran away.
I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.	I feel so bad. I forgot to lock the gate. No, but I put up a lot of posters, so hopefully I find him before my neighbor comes back.
Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?	I used to have this obnoxious neighbor who stayed up all night playing League of Legends, he drove me nuts screaming into his headset all hours of the day and night.
You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.	His parents paid his bills so no, he didn't understand that sadly. I tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn't get the picture as he kept doing it.
What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?	i have a new job offer, but im not sure if i should take it
Yeah, I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.	well, it is retail.  ive done retail and it is not fun.
lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time	So this one time I walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself. He just taught himself to do it, I had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool.
wow , i would love to have a cat like yours	I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.
Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?	I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things.
haha that must have been a crazy concert!	It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.
Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as, say, an administrative job	This friend of mine is constantly job hopping, I don't even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily, whereas when I left my last job I could barely get interviews.
Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture	She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.
OOO I love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?	I am ready to start renovating the rest of my house.
Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!	I finished my kitchen, so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really.
That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?	This morning I woke up and I was in such a good mood that I just started singing in the shower.
Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!	I don't know, I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.
I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff	I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little, how different the world was.
Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids	Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!
I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?	For my birthday last year, a coworker gave me cheese. It sounds ridiculous but I was touched by her thoughtfulness. I love cheese!
Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?	Smoked gouda, one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha
Aww poor baby, hopefully shes doing fine now.	My cat had really bad breath so I took her in to the dentist. It turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled, poor thing was in so much pain.
That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.	She's doing great, thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.
Ha, I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.	When I was a kid, I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's, just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food.
True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!	Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.
Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?	I'm so nervous. I had a job interview the other day and haven't heard back yet.
I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!	They said within the week, I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!
Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)	Unfortunately, I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.
"I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like ""okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?"" Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying."	I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!
Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?	I went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that I did not order.
I would have complained.	It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.
Ohh, I feel sorry for you	Since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away, I usually spend Thanksgiving alone. It sucks sometimes.
Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!	Oh don't feel bad, I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.
Yes, I feel you. Cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!	I spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment. It sucked at the time but it was so nice when I was done to just chill out and watch TV.
Me too! You seem just like me!	Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.
That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?	My husband and I closed on our first house last week!
That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!	It is! Lots of blood, sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things, haha. We can't wait to move in!
Are there any other family members out there that could help her?	my daughter moved to California and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing I could immediately do.
Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out.	No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.
That's great! I am happy for you!	Recently I was contacted by my former company, begging to get me back. I felt really good about the salary negotiation since I knew they needed me.
Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!	Thanks, I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week, it's pretty amazing.
i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule	i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !
same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will	yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.
I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past, so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.	My dog died this past December and I've had a really hard time getting over it. She was our family pet.
Aww that's great! What breed?	She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently, which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives.
Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?	The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy.
Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long	Yes, thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!
I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.	my doggie recently passed away
Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!	no i don't think so, but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.
oh man, that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.	The other day I woke up and without looking I stepped in warm cat vomit.
how many cats do have?	Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey, I should have known better and watched where I was walking.
Aw, I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?	My dog died last year.
They say dogs are mans best friend.	About 5 years. He was a rescue.
What kind of dog was he?	That's true. He was definitely mine.
Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere.	He was a pit and lab mix.
Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago, I know how terrible that feels.	The worst phone call I ever got in my life was when I was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live.
Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day,	I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.
surprise gifts are always fun.	The other day I checked my email and a former client I did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! I was happy.
that sounds like a well deserved plan.	Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.
Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment	I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters, but just being there changed my mind quickly.
Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away	Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.
that sounds prettty bad!	i lost $100 cash somewhere. I have looked everywhere and i can't find it
I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.	yes, i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.
Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!	i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.
I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think.	I really hate when people let their kids run wild in public. I do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it.
The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.	The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly.
What store were you at?	I wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out.
Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer?	I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today.
Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better?	it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared
Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.	thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!
That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.	yes she is honestly the greatest
Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol	I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more?
That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.	Right! It's almost like, you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!
Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.	I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout, I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up.
Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.	Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.
Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?	When I was in high school there was a girl I had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend.
Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.	"Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my ""friend"" asked her out."
Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that	I had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out.  Some time later I found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one.
That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times	Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.
That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now	I cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her VPK graduation.
That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!	Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.
Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?	I entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won $1000.
Bills do take up a lot, don't they.	Oh they are long gone,lol. Bills to pay and all.
Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?	One time I moved into a new apartment, it was this big loft in a converted warehouse. I had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound, I thought the place was haunted!
How did you discover exactly what it was?	Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.
Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?	I have a fear for roller coaster but I let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night.
I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!	Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride.
I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.	I had to put my cat down a few years ago, she was old and in kidney failure.
You went through a lot of losses.	She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat, she came to live with me when my mom died.
That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall.	Someone buggy was in the way at Publix and I tripped and fell in the aisle.
Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay.	I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly.
Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!	I applied for a job one time where I was one of 4 people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if I got it.
Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?	I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.
I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?	I remember being younger and waiting on Christmas Day to unwrap presents.  There were a lot of things I wanted that year.
The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?	Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.
Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?	I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating.
I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!	You're right, the other people probably hardly noticed. And no, thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.
How'd the hurricane go?	This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries, canned goods, beer. I was set!
Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.	Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest, though glad we were safe.
Was he okay?	I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it.
Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.	He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it, he is a very nervous dog.
Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.	That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.
I bet he is. Don't worry	I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.
That is a great idea	I usually food prep for the week it is so much easier.
Saving money is important	Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track.
That's amazing! You must be so proud.	My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year
She's also a hard worker.	Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.
That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.	Yesterday my Lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment. I thought that was super nice, there were A LOT of bags.
Good to know there is still kind people in the world.	It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it, I didn't want to hold him up.
That's awesome! Who were they from?	I got some pink roses at work last week I was so happy.
That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.	My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.
You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.	I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband, our four kids, and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though
That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!	I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough.
We all do things we regret when drinking	I sent an email I shouldn't have sent. I'd been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when I did.
Thats usually how it goes	True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days, worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.
You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?	A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here.
hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.	It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.
I wish you luck	I'm going back to school I am going to stick to my goal and don't stop until I get my degree.
I am sure you will meet them	Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.
That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?	I spent my birthday last year alone. I expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope.
I would have been disappointed, too.	Yeah, he acted like it was just a normal day, it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.
Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.	I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer.
Oh right, I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.	Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next.
Cool. Was it interesting?	I went to a book release party yesterday.
Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol	Yes. It was a good friend of mine. She got a novel published! She also has four small kids. I'm not sure how she does it all.
ARe you happy or sad?	My best friend is moving across the country next week.
I bet. I she moving school or a job?	Sad. I will miss her terribly
Oh cool that's great! What were you doing that they recognised?	My job recognized me for my hard work I was thankful and surprised I just love my job.
Awesome. What is your job?	For over exceeding and helping all staff when in need, I am always just helpful but was happy to get noticed for my hard work.
Wow was it a scam or was it legit?	I got a random email this morning with a $120 gift voucher
That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?	I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago!
Oh no, what happened?	"There was an ""incident"" at the gym today."
Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!	I finished a fabulous workout, then promptly fell UP the stairs on my way to the locker room. In front of everyone. I was mortified.
That's great. Are you excited?	After four long, broke months of looking, I finally got offered a job today!
Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.	Yes, and incredibly happy. I was getting really worried about the bills.
Was it real?	I had an email telling me I had a $120 gift voucher this morning
That's awesome. What are you going to buy?	Haha that was my first thought too. It actually was!
Australia. I hope to go there some day	Thanks! No idea actually, it's for a department store here in Australia
I bet, I will get there one day	You definitely should! It's a really cool place, but so hard to see everything because it's so big
I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother	I knocked over a clothing display on the sidewalk outside of a boutique the other day when I was riding my bike. I should have gone back to pick it up but kept going.
Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks	I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time.
That has happend to me too.	I was waiting for a while for a video game to come out.  When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.
You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though	I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time.
We live and we learn lol	That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.
I used to love that band	The other day I was listening to Spotify and put U2's Achtung Baby on. It reminds me of pre middle school days.
I have not either	Yeah they were great back in the day. I can't comment on their new stuff, I haven't listened to any of it in years.
Probably at 4 or 5! lol	So the cable repair guy was supposed to show up between 8:30 and 12:30 on Friday. Guess when he showed up....
No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?	You got it. 5:00. WHY does this still happen? I wasted the whole day waiting.
Was it real because I get those every day lol	I got a random email telling me I had won a gift card
I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol	Haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! It was for $120
oh no! what happened?	We had a near-disaster at our house today.
ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse	My older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper. It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately, we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.
Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.	We went to our favorite Italian restaurant for dinner tonight.
That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy	"It was good! It always is. I had my ""usual"" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed, but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday."
Hm, that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation, since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened, or what did that mean?	I didn't have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location
Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm, no foul.	Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep
I bet that was a nice feeling	I recently got an email from my old company hinting that they wanted me back. It was kind of exciting, I really wanted it to work out.
That sounds perfect	It definitely was. The money is great and I get to set my own hours!
The dentist makes me a bit nervous	I have a dentist appointment first thing tomorrow morning.
Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!	It makes me VERY nervous. I hate it. I'll probably barely sleep tonight because of it.
That is awful, did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number?	I got back from vacation last week and found a huge dent in my car.
You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot, maybe they can track down the car.	No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed.
What kind of food was there?	I went to the fanciest dinner party the other night. It was  eight amazing courses of food!
It is nice that you enjoyed it.	Really intricate things - souffles and such. I was very impressed.
Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?	I saw a mouse run across my kitchen last night. I woke everyone up with my screaming.
Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well	Stood on the couch and screamed some more! I do not do rodents. I'm having my son handle it. I think he's putting out traps tonight.
Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.	My kitty that I had since she was a kitten passed away. She was only four years old.
It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well, just think of all the good times and be thankful.	"It really is. She was the first pet that was really ""mine"". She brought a lot of happiness to my life!"
That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests	I had a test the other day and I'm pretty sure I aced it. I studied for like a week!
Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence	Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college, it was a wakeup call.
Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?	So all my friends went on vacation last week :(
I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D	Yeah, we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work. I got to see all the pictures on Facebook though, ha! So envious.
I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!	Sounds like a plan :)
That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?	Man I am stuffed.  I found a new pizza joint in town.
You are lucky.	Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.  This place had a all you can eat buffet.  I ate my fill of pizza!
Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?	Man I couldn't get any sleep last night.
Hopefully you had a lock on them, you can never be too safe.	There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.
Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.	One year for our anniversary, an iPad showed up at my office. My boyfriend had ordered it and timed it so arrived on our exact anniversary. I didn't expect it at all!
That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!	"He's generous yeah but I wouldn't call it ""showering."" He's just good about knowing what I need!"
I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?	I used to enjoy cold showers in the morining.
I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !	It's very cold and refreshing, wakes you up instantly.
wow that is very rude of her	My neighbor refuses to clean up after her dog and it's infuriating.
No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me	It really is. I'm not sure what to do though besides reporting her to the HOA. Any suggestion?
I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.	What else do we need, just a sunny bench and some chips.
Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!	So lets go, I'll meet you outside in an hour.
I will be expecting to see you there.	I am looking forward for tomorrow.
Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.	Yes, tomorrow as well as today are such a nice places.
Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?	I was walking around town yesterday and saw a girl with crazy hairstyle.
Is that a reference to the color of the hair, the shape or something else?	It was...Dandelion.
How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!	Man I felt good when I applied for my job!
Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.	No I was very assured in my interview.  I got the job, probably because of my attitude.
Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly, once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality.	I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.
I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.	It can be, but personality can't make up for incomptence either.
Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!	I flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time. I can't believe how much time has passed.
I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.	Enjoy it, your 30s go by really fast. I'm clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself.
Yeah, it's like a small world.	It's very strange when you meet somebody you know, in the middle of a megalopolis.
I think it is merely a coincidence.	Exactly, how does it even work?
Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?	Small thing in life used to make me shed tears.
Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry	Yes, things like great classical music for example.
I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times.	We have to stay positive through all the things that happen in the world.
Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important.	Yes, that's a good start.
That's awesome!  What do they do?	Someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise.
That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.	They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.
That sucks. How fast were you driving?	Last week driving to work, I got pulled over for speeding.
I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit	Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.
Oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow	I haven't drank beer in almost a year, but yesterday I relapsed. I feel like such a loser.
Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans, we make mistakes.	I just can't believe I gave in to the pressure. Oh well, yeah your right. I'll start by taking baby steps.
That is probably so annoying	My neighbor is remodeling his house, which I hate, because they start at 5:30 in the morning.
That really sucks. How long will it be going on?	I have a 3 year old, so he wakes up at 5:30 because of all the hammering going on.
Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky, depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?	My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby.
Well, then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck, and enjoy this time! :)	Yeah, it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.
Why not?	I went to see a movie last night. I wasn't really able to enjoy it though.
Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.	There was this couple sitting two rows in front of me.... they just wouldn't shut up.
I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again?	I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. It was alright, but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first.
right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!!	I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.
Is she doing okay now?	My mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer.
great, I am very glad to hear she is getting better!	Yes, she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving.
What is the job?	I was very pleased to get this job
Well congrats then, I am sure that is not easy	I got the job has an software Analysis and that was aim
What caused that to happen?	I was so angry, I threw a bottle of water!
Oh gosh, hopefully it doesnt happen next time	A server went down and I didn't get paid for my work :(
What were the photos of?	i felt nostalgic looking through old photos today
It is good to have those and look at once in awhile	just old family photos
I am sorry to hear that, what happened?	A couple months ago, my wife and I got divorced.
Did you try therapy at all or counseling?	We just grew apart I guess. House seems so empty with her and the kids gone.
Why is that?	We can't afford to live in our home anymore
I am sorry to hear that, I hope things improve for you a ton!	We're poor, and bills are adding up
Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many	Boy, it's been a lot of owrk
I interpret the difficulties	What sort of things?
the lack of humor	What sort of difficulties/
Ok	Ah, it's no joke is it
Oh goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?	Last year, my father passed away.
That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.	Yeah, he developed a stage 4 glioma in his brain that could not be removed.
What kind of stuff is in there?	i feel nostalgic going through old boxes in my basement
Oh okay, I love going through my old stuff too, it is really fun	just old sports uniforms and toys and stuff like that
That sounds so fun!	I have plans so go to the beach with my wife for a week next month
I hope you both have tons of fun!	I cant wait! we have been looking forward to going back since our honeymoon.
that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.	I'm so glad my health is good
i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me	We do, and don't do enough to take care of it
Uh OH what happened	Oh man. I can't believe I made that mistake at work today.
Oh no, well mistakes do happen, it will be behind you in a few days	I was giving a presentation on the project that I'm working on, and I overlooked something simple.... one of my coworkers called me out on it. How embarrassing.
Exactly good luck	I certainly hope so. The sooner everyone forgets about this, the better.
Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?	I love to see old stuff from when I was a kid
I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?	Old metal lunch boxes like Charlies Angels speed buggy ect
Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.	Hong Kong Phooey lol
Oh, OK!  WHere are you moving to?	It's time to move!
That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!	Another house, it's closer to school
That's exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?	So there's a girl that I've been talking to lately... I'm thinking about asking her out.
What all is on the agenda for the date?	Yeah, I already have it all planned out. We get along really well, so I'm sure she's going to say yes.
Great. Are you going to get it published?	I've finally finished writing the book that I've been working on for the last few months.
What is the book about?	Definitely! I'm pretty happy with this one, can't wait to get it published.
Boo. What genre?	To say anything about it at all would be giving too much away!
OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?	Oh man. I was cleaning out my fridge, and found something unpleasant.
You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again	Well I threw it out. It was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container. It had been in there for months, I think.
Oh no! What happened?	My little one got injured
Ouch. I hope she's okay.	She fell off a kitchen stool
thats good, its always a good feeling after	Whew. I had a lot of housework to get done, but it's finally finished.
thats the way to do it	Yeah, I'm pretty happy. Now I can just sit back and relax.
Did his team win?	i was delighted with how well my nephew did at his little league game
That's great news! I bet you're so proud.	yes
Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?	My clothing is making me crazy
That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!	They're totally itchy
Storms are the worst and destroy so much.	i admired the way my nieghbors helped each other out after a storm
My family went through a big storm a few years ago.	they are horrible, luckily this one wasnt deadly or too destructive
what happened on the phone call?	I got a terrible phone call yesterday...
I am so sorry about that.	I found out that my brother died.
Has it made any scratch marks?	Ugh, my cat keeps attacking my foot.
Have you tried disciplining him in anyway	Nah, he just keeps running up, grabbing and biting, then running away. It was cute and funny at first, now it's just irritating.
Sounds like it's time for a crate.	Yeah, I've sprayed him with a water bottle a few times, it doesn't seem to work very well.
Yea, I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone.	it is frustrating waiting on hold to speak to a human
I think as we get smarter, it will get better.	it is so annoying!
Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!	I didn't expect to get anything for my birthday from my fiance since he's been broke, but he gave me a bouquet of flowers and took me out to eat still!
It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!	It really was! He had to scrimp and save, but it was worth it for both of us in the end :)
Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?	So.... my dog got hit by a car last night.
That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!	No, unfortunately he didn't make it.
Did you let him borrow it?	My son asked to borrow the keys to my car this morning.
That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?	Yeah. I know most people would be worried about doing something like that, but... I trust him not to do anything stupid.
Awesome. Alls well that ends well.	Yeah, he brought it back in one piece. Which I'm obviously happy about.
Did you say yes?	My daughter asked to borrow my car to go out tonight...
Where does she plan to go?	I haven't given an answer yet. I'm just not sure if it's a wise idea or not.
Money problems are never fun. Trust me, I know.	Boy, it was nice when I wasn't so poor
Yeah, definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?	I'm sorry to hear that :( It'd be nice if work paid better
Oh no, I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life, and they're truly part of the family.	I was sad when I had to put my dog down last month
Yes, they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life, so try to take comfort in that.	They are very much family. I cannot believe we get so attached.
That is great! Doing what?	I was recently promoted at my job. I didn't expect it to happen, but I got it through hard work so I'm pretty excited about it!
I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!	Thank you! I'm now a district manager for a local chain of businesses. It's not my favorite thing to do, but the raise is great!
I can never go on long trips.	I recently went on a long road trip. I wasn't too worried, though, because I packed everything I needed to make it as stress-free as possible. '
I can no longer afford them, long trips cost the most.	Why not? They used to bother me, but I'm finding that as I get older, they're not so bad.
Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?	I kept laughing at myself for falling down
How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.	Not bad but it was funny because I slipped on a banana peel!
I am bad at every game.	I compete in the Highland games around the country. I just got a new kilt and I look amazing.
I still could not do that, I am very weak human person.	It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs, hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.
Do what i did, quit the job and live at home with mom.	I've been very stressed out at work. I had it in my budget so I hired a new office manager. I'm having issues trusting her.
I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.	I wish. My mom kicked me out at 14 and I've only seen her a handful of times since over the last 20 years.
That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off, but I know many people still struggle with it	I just pulled up my student loan bill. I've been out of school 10 years and still owe 75k.
Yea...the education costs are atrocious and, honestly, not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so	It started off at 150k so I've paid a lot but it's still crazy. Make me think I would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college.
Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.	My boss is piling on the work but keeping my pay the same. He claims he can't afford to pay me more, but I know that's not true.
What kind of job do you have?	Yep, it's so frustrating. I'm ready to shake up the system but I feel limited in what I can do, besides quit.
I'm sorry, did anyone see?	I'm so shocked, my pants fell down in public
I hope you would wear a belt next time.	I'm hoping not, but it's possible
That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.	My best friend has the best job ever. She is paid to travel the world full time and write Blogs on different locations.
I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!	Yes, I know. Ever day I drive an hour to the same place that is slowly killing me inside and she is jetting off to explore.
LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.	Just finished my budget for the week. Woowa, I'm in trouble it's going to be a rice and beans week.
eww LOL	It's better then the alternative. One good meal then water and ketchup soup the rest of the week.
Happy Birthday!	I just had my birthday, and my family and fiance did everything they could to make it special. I don't have much, but I'm thankful to have them at least.
What all did they do for you?	Thank you! I hope your birthday, whenever it is, is awesome as well!
How long did it take for you to teach you dog that?	I was proud when my dog learned to sit.
I thought I would take longer, like months!	A few days. He was so happy!
Oh no. Maybe you can get some things done around the house.	This week my work offered to let me work an extra day. I thought great overtime. Nope they plan to send me home every other day to even it out
Lol, That sounds like a plan. Working two jobs is hard.	Yea like working on my resume and netflix.
Yummy... what did you eat?  I am hungry.	I'm so happy I ate good food
That sounds so good.  Like I love that stuff.	I had chicken, asparagus, and a portobello mushroom
I am glad no one in your family is sick.	"I""m so happy that no one in my family is sick"
Thank goodness my family is healthy too.	Thank you! I hope no one in yours is either
But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still,	went for a job interview. I got the job offer but they offered me less money then I all ready make for more work.
Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes	Not for the first few years. The title would be a move up in status but the pay is about a 20% downgrade. I can't take that loss.
is there a special reason?	I'm so excited to go out to dinner tomorrow!
going anywhere good?	No, we just won't be home so we have to eat out
that sounds fun	Pickle Barrel
That is great. How have you done it?	I'm been loosing weight January. I'm down 50 pounds. I have 10 more to go but I'm happy.
That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile.	I've always walked a lot at work. I average 10 miles a day so kept doing that but I cut out all processed food and drinks.
I have never been on a trip before.	My wife went on a trip for a week to see her family but I had to work so I had to stay home alone.
I have long weeks every single day.	I wish I could have went on this one but I couldn't. It ended up bein a long week by myself.
I would just quit and live off the government.	My current job isn't working out, so I've applied to several others.
Everyone can! Just gotta try.	Haha, I would if I could! Sounds a like much more laidback way to live.
how sweet and thoughtful of you	I found a new stray dog eating out the dumpster last Thursday. Today I officially adopted her.
You seem to be a very compassionate person, very kindhearted.	I already love her. This is the second stray I've found eating out the same dumpster. They are now sisters.
Ohh, I so sorry.	About 6 years ago I was diagnosed with cancer.
Hope you are doing better. I'll pray for you.	Thank you, it was a very scary situation to be in.
Good for you! stay healthy	I'm doing good now after the chemo and radiation. It is in total remission now.
Forget that! Eat pizza and enjoy life.	I've been trying to eat healthier and work out more, but so far I've only been somewhat successful.
I agree, I eat what I want when I want all the time.	Oh I definitely do both of those things as much as I can. Pizza = perfection
You have to have fun!	I'm so scared to move to a new home
Get drunk and go out!	How can I do that?
I never go to the store anymore, I wish i did.	Just got home from the grocery store. Forgot my wallet at home. Got to check out and had to apologize to the cashier and leave with out anything.
Not for me, i shop online mostly these days.	Why not? Dollar store has something for everyone.
Just go for it! Never look back!	I'm about to start a new job, and I'm really nervous about it.
Best of luck my friend, you can do anything.	Okay, I'll take your advice! Wish me luck!
I own an animal shelter here in my home town.	I get so mad when I watch shows about animal shelters and see how many people abuse animals.
I try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs.	It must be so hard to deal with emotionally at times. Just watching a show makes me want to lash out.
That's great! I hope she goes to a good graduate school.	My daughter killed the GRE!
I am very happy for you!	Thank you! Me too :)
I am so sorry to hear that she has passed.  How long has she been gone?	I'm devastated by my mother's death,5|5|5_5|5|5,
I know how you feel.	21 years, but I miss her every single day
296	340
296	340
Is your friend ok? What kind of car was it?	A friend of mine was in a car accident
That is horrible news, I am so sorry for your loss.	He was driving a compact and a truck hit him.  He didn't make it unfortunately
Is that good or bad?  Sometimes extra work can be a blessing, unless you are salaried, then it's just more work.	A co-worker told me we were going to have a lot of work coming up
I hope so too.  What kind of work is it?	Bad if anything, I just hope it isn't overwhelming
Oh, I am sorry for your loss	my father recently passed suddenly, i was devastated
Don't feel bad now. What's done is done	thank you. i am having trouble getting over it.
I can understand. I am really sorry	Yes, but I really miss him.
Oh no! Was anyone hurt?	There was a 2 car accident this morning a driver going the wrong way it had traffic backed up.
That is so sad. I hope they recover okay. Hopefully you weren't in trouble for being late either.	Yes one driver was in critical condition and car ran into the side of the express way it was unfortunate but I was over a hour late for work.
That is awesome, are they coming to visit you?	i am excited to see my son and his fiance!
Awesome! I'm not a father yet, but I can only imagine your kids growing up and leaving to live their own lives.	Yes! In October. I haven't seen him in a few months.
Aw, I'm sorry, did you just forget or you were thinking about other things?	i didn't ask my husband if i could buy something, now he is mad and i feel bad.
Yeah, had a similar scuffle with my wife, but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget.	I didn't think he would mind.  But it was expensive, so maybe i should have asked.
I have never liked spiders.	The bugs that creep me out the most is those eight legged spiders I seen a huge one in my car this weekend.
You should always have bug spray on you at all times.	Me either I screamed so loud lol I be afraid thy may crawl on me I would freak out.
That is really scary. Are you home alone?	I hear something tapping outside my bathroom door. I don't know what it is and I am really scared.
I'm sure you are fine. I bet it is just a tree branch or something like that. Maybe a neighbor could go look for you.	Yes! I don't have a gun or anything!
YAY, a promotion is always amazing.  when do you start?	I got a new position at my job more money and also happy to be recognized for my hard work.
Thats amazing, financial stability can be a life changer.	I actually started today it was a lot of information to take in but it was such a joy.
Maybe they're very eager to go a certain item.	I hate going to walmart. People just walk right out in front of you and don't even say excuse me!
True, because regretfully I act that way sometimes too.	Maybe. It's that hunter gatherer mentality.  Get it before everyone else.
Yeah I hear you! Do you like to read or watch TV?	I love being lazy on weekends. It's nice to just relax and have nothing to worry about.
I like to do both as well. TV if I'm feeling lazy, reading if I feel more ambitious.	Both! I spend more time watching TV though. How about you?
Oh no!! How did you dry them?	I can be so forgetful I left my windows down in my car and my seats was full of water.
Oh that sounds awful! But at least no one stole anything from your car.	They are still air drying what makes it worse I sat in the sets and it looked like I wet myself lol a little embarrassing.
Did you take it back that is so disgusting.	I found a hair in my pizza, and now I can't eat
I wouldn't want another either it takes one time for me to find hair, bug etc and I am done with the restaurant.	I called them and told them about it. They said the next pizza would be free. I said no thanks.
Best way to ensure your food is clean and free of hair cook it yourself.	Yes indeed.  I think i am done with eating out for a while
That sounds great! I really pays off to be prepared.	I recently went on a long trip by car. For the first time, it wasn't stressful because I packed everything I needed for it to run smoothly.
That sounds like some efficient planning! I hope you enjoy your trip!	Yes it does. I was able to eliminate several meal breaks which cut over three hours off my trip time!
I can understand you. But this is the cycle of life, right? Kids grow and they have to find their own way of life in this world	Ever since my kids left and went to college I am such a loner.
Good for you. You can also call your friends to hang out if you have close ones	Yes you are right at least I have my cats to keep me company lol so I'm not to much alone.
Oh no, I'm sorry. Did you stay long?	i didn't get to see my favorite character when i went to disney world.
Maybe she was around, but it wasn't time for the ball yet.	I was there for 4 days.  I wanted to see Cinderella but I kept missing her.
That's wonderful. He'll be so excited when he finds out!	I have a special dinner arranged for me and my husband this week.
I hope you guys have a great time. Just the two of you.	Yes he will it's his birthday and we can have a night alone no kids just a nice dinner.
Concerts can be a lot of fun! Will you be going to another one?	I went to my first official concert last month I was so amazed it was a surprise to even go there.
I've never been to a Beyonce concert. Always sold out! I'm glad you got to see her.	Yes if they can outdo Queen Bey lol we saw Beyonce and she put on a awesome show a night to remember.
Congratulations! Good to hear your hard work is paying off.	I am really pleased with my job performance lately. I will be getting that promotion for sure.
You should definitely be proud of yourself. Pat yourself on the back.	Yes i am delighted and kinda proud of myself.  I have worked very hard.
Yeah I hope you get it! I'm sure they will recognize the extra time you've been doing.	I have put in so many hours at work hoping to get a promotion. Fingers crossed it works
Wow, I hope you're getting paid for all that extra time!	i really hope so. I have worked 60+ hours a week for the last 6 months.
Sorry to hear that my friend.. Was she facing an emergency?	My girlfriend moved some of our mutual money without letting me know
I know it sucks, but i think you should have an open conversation to your girl about this	Not really. I dont know what she used it for, she has not told anything to me so far
That is a tragedy! Where do you think you left it? Did you check your pockets?	im so mad! I can't find my hair brush!
Interesting. I hope you do find it. I don't know how you brush your hair.	i have checked everywhere.  i think my dog may have snatched it.
How does that make you feel?	my husband has been texting a woman he works with
I am so sorry to hear you're going through this. Hopefully, it's nothing.	very very bad, and suspicious.
Oh, so you always prepare well huh?	I want to see all the ingredients on the table before i start to cook
I always wanted that level of discipline. good for you :)	Yeah, i am one of those people who want to know everything is set before starting something
Congratulations! boy or girl	i am so happy that i am going to be a grandma
well, as long as its a happy healthy baby you guys will be fine	we don't know yet, she is only a few months along
Yep. Happy and healthy is a blessing	yes that is all i want really
What's the band?	i am not going to be able to see my favorite band when they come to town
Wow. That must suck. Do you like the band incubus? I missed them a couple of times but I saw them this year	def leppard.  they are going to be with reo speedwagon and tesla too.
yes. I wish I could send you a clip of it from the concert. It was awesome. Maybe you could catch def leppard next time.	i do, they did a song called wish you were here that i loved.
That sounds really cool.	I went to a comic book convention last month
Oh, such great nostalgia.	Yeah. i felt like i was a child again, standing amidst all those superheroes
oof that sucks.	i caught my husband looking at another woman
yea you shouldnt be	yes.  i wasn't too happy about it.
well hopefully you find a better path in life	i questioned him about it and he denied it.  but i caught him red handed.
Oh wow, i did not even know about the transfer. I bet Laker fans are delighted	I am really looking forward to this season of the Lakers, with Lebron coming in
So true. I might become a lakers fan myself at this point	They are on cloud 9! With such a legend on their team, who wouldn't be, right?
That really sucks. Have you tried taking some melatonin?	im feeling blue because my days and nights are mixed up
Yeah, it works wonders for me when I can't sleep.	i have tried taking benadryl and some other sleep aid.  i should try melatonin.
Oh god.. so sorry to hear that.. May i ask how did Tom pass?	I felt really lonely when my dog tom passed away last month
I can feel your emotions. Find peace in knowing that Tom is at a better place now	He was old. He was my childhood dog and he was always with me all the time
Why are you so thankful? Is it Thanksgiving?	i am so thankful for my family. they are the best!
That's great to hear. It's always good to have a great family support structure when times are hard.	they are very good to me. they are always there for me.
Oh no, that is a terrible thing to do.	I was so angry when my brother played a prank by tying a firecracker on our dog's tail
I applaud your response.	Yeah.. He always plays pranks, but this one made me furious. I went to him and gave him a punch so that he learns to respect animals
Oh no!!!  Did it smell bad?	my cat vomited in the floor and i stepped in it!
Ewwwww!  Hope the cat is okay!	no just really gross, all warm and mushy between my toes.
Sounds exciting.  I wish you the best of luck!	I am ready for school to start! I can't wait to teach my first class.
Don't worry everyone is nervous on the first day.	Thank you! I am a little nervous, but I am sure everything will be great.
thats an awful thing to do! what did you do?	I was furious when my brother lit a firecracker tying it to our dog's tail
i am so glad that you did	I gave him a punch right away. thats no way to treat animals.
oh no.. what happened? did you face a financial loss?	i am sad that i won't be able to buy a new car.
so sorry to hear that.. hopefully things work out for you real soon	no my credit is not great and they turned me down for the loan.
Great! Don't be nervous, be confident.  Works like a charm.	i have a job interview next week
Don't be. Just visualize yourself already having the job.	thank you so much.. i am feel so much anxious about it
Congrats	i was so happy when my friends threw me a party for my graduation
Was it fun?	thank you! i never expected it, so i was pleasantly surprised
That is no good dude	i was so angry when a friend of mine made a pass at my girlfriend
You should. and get new friend	yeah. i am thinking about confronting him about it
You did! That's so cool!	i was shocked when i heard that i had won the lottery!
Any free money is great.	Yes! It was only 200 but still, it's more than i had!
Oh that sounds exciting! when do you go?	i am really looking forward to my new job in miami
A new start and a new life, that is exciting! I hope you love it.	next week. and i am starting next month. i am looking forward to the new city and life
mine too.. the nature is so peaceful and beautiful during the fall	I am looking forward to fall. It is my favorite season.
i have been there, it is so lovely. you are going to love it	yes. It is nice to travel to the mountains in the fall. I plan to go to gatlinburg sometime soon.
Ewww. I would have been too	i was so grossed out when a friend of mine threw up on me
Did anyone video it?	we were at a party, he had too much whiskey and he unloaded on me like anything!
Aw that's awful, how old was it?	i was heartbroken when my dog passed away last month
I hope you're holding up then, I would be devastated if my pet died.	12. he was old.. but then i cant remember a memory without him in it as well
yea thank god he didnt go to the GSW	i am really looking forward to this season of Lakers with LeBron coming in
yea i bet they are	haha very true.. Lakers fans are so thrilled at the moment
you have eyes too	my husband doesn't seem interested in me anymore. I think he may have eyes for someone else.
Have eyes for someone else	yes i do?
oh yea i know how that feels	i felt so alone in miami when i moved there
it really does suck	it was my first time staying away from the family. felt dreadful!
that movie scared me to death, and i usually dont scare very easy.	i was so scared when i went to watch the conjuring movie in the theatres
oh my lord!!! how did you sleep that night?	yeah! and to think that i went alone and at night!
Oh no!  What happened/	im a little nervous about my court date tomorrow
Okay good.  I think everything is going to be okay!  Keep your head up, friend!	I have to testify as a witness.
Im sorry to hear that	memories of my dog break my heart.. she passed away last month
Was she really sick?	thanks.. She was old, but still, i feel so alone without her
Eggplant is gross but hey now you know! lol	I ate eggplant for the first time, and I hated it
I can't either!  I tried it once and I'm like you......NO MORE!	Yes! It was so awful, I can't see how people eat it.
That's so messed up! Why was he doing that?	i was so mad when i saw my brother lighting up a firecracker tying it to my dog's tail
Good to hear, how old was he?	He plays pranks, but this was way over the line! i went to him and threw a punch at him. i dont think he will be doing that anymore
ME too. Marvel movies are the best. Im late I just saw wonderwomAN	i can't wait to see the next avengers movie!!
OH my word. I feel like I should watch them all over	Yeah, and since the infinity war second part is going to answer all the mysteries, it is going to be legendary
is he sick?	my dad is going to get his heart checked tomorrow
Does he has any record with heart problems?	He was not feeling well last week.. i am really hoping his heart is fine
oh wow that really sucks	i feel heartbroken whenever memories of my brother pops into my head
dang that is rough	we lost him 5 years ago to an accident
That's so sad! Did he at least die of old age?	i was so heartbroken when my dog died last month
I'm so sorry to hear that, may he rest in peace.	he was hit by a truck.. i cant even imagine it
Is that because you just like being organized?	i want to see all the ingredients neatly lined up on the table before i start cooking
That is really a good way to be. I need to practice this more, myself!	Yes, i want to be prepared all this time, it is just the way i am
Bed is always a source of comfort for me. Especially, after work when I feel so drained and stressed out	i am pretty comfy right now in my bed. i feel very relaxed.
Indeed. Particularly, when i grab my phone and watch short clips from my favorite TV shows on Youtube	Yes that is the best time.  I like to come home, fix some food, and dive into my bed.  It is such a comfort.
aw I'm sorry to hear.  Did you conquer your loneliness?	i was feeling so alone in florida when i moved there
I'm glad you were able to adjust.  It can be lonely without family around.	i did. i had gotten a new job there, and it was my first time being away from my family
oh no.. why are you feeling that way?	I am scared that I won't be able to get up tomorrow morning
That sucks.. Are you having trouble falling asleep?	i have to get up at 8 am, and it's already 4.
How did that go exactly?	i saw angeline jolie the other day
She is the most beautiful girl I have ever seen.	I saw her coming out of a restaurant. She still looks so gorgeous, such a timeless beauty!
i dont blame you! i would have also!	i was so grossed out when a friend threw up on me
nasty! did you tell him anything?	we were at a party and he had too much whiskey inside him.
Oh wow! I am so sorry that happened to you.	i was so mad when i found out our dogwalker used to torchur my dog
I would have called the cops on her!	Thanks.. i fired her right then and there
What type of car was it?	i once saw a man lift a car all by himself!
That must have been a very big man.	it was a fiat
thats so nice, love when that happens	i found 100 dollars in an old coat I had in storage!
that nice, good for you	yes it was definitely great, and couldn't have come at a better time.
oh yea whys that?	I would love to buy a travel trailer, but I'm not sure if it would be a good idea.
oh that makes a lot of sense	i have heard they aren't good quality. They have lots of problems.
What do you plan on doing today?	I am going to have a great day today! I feel good and I am standing tall
I want some of whatever you had for breakfast. You seem very happy.	I plan on going out and conquering the world! I feel like a million bucks.
Sorry to hear that! Why do you think that might happen?	I am frightened that i will lose my job.
Hopefully that doesn't happen, and you have job security.	They have been laying people off, and the last person started a week after i didn
That's pretty embarrassing haha. Ever find out what it was?	I sat in something wet and didn't know it. Walked around all day with a wet rear.
That would make sense, though you could probably have smelt it if it was coffee.	I still don't know. I'm sure it was pop or coffee.
Oh damn that's so sad. Was it salvageable?	I am so upset! My phone was on top of my car and it fell off and shattered
It definitely sounds that way, gonna upgrade it?	Nope, completely destroyed. I will have to buy a new one. So inconvenient.
oh yea i had those out 2 years ago it sucks	my son had his wisdom teeth removed, and i took the opportunity to baby him a bit. he is 24
yea it can be sore and you cant eat anything	yes he was pretty pitiful.  funny at first, but then he started hurting. i felt bad for him.
im glad i still have mine around.	I wish i could see my father one more time
exactly what i do. we were never close growig up. we are now.	spend as much time as you can with him. you never know when you won't be able to anymore.
Wow, what is chiller theatre? I'm intrigued.	i miss watching chiller theatre with my family on fridays
Must be fun but unnerving as well. Whats your favourite horror movie?	it was a show that came on at midnight that would play scary movies. first 3d movie i ever saw was on the show. got the 3d glasses free with a pizza. lol
What happened to you?	Hi I just wanted to tell you about a special thing that happend to me
Your best friends?	I was at work one day and I came home and some special people were there
really what kind of sweets did you eat?	I ate too many sweets the other day, they were so good though.
I love cookies especially oreo's they are my favorite	I don't remember the name, but they looked like regular cookies.
That is nice to have good memories.	You know when I was a kid we took a lot of fun vacations
Did you go with your cousins?	yeah I remember going to fun places like Busch Gardens and riding on coasters
Why is that	It was hard for my brother through out school
I was too	he really was motivated in highsool  high school
No, I don't get any golden opportunity. did you  ?	Hello did you ever get to go to Disney when you were young?
Don't worry. Earn for it and go!!	No we were poor growing up and it always made me sad that we didn't have the opportunity to go
Oh no. Floodwaters can be devastating. Was there a lot of damage?	We had record rainfall in my town this past spring causing a lot of flooding.
Good thing you were prepared.	Yes, there was, the town was very damaged. We had sandbagged around our home and managed to save our house.
Did yall make up	I got into a argument with a coworker of mine this past month.
That is not good	No,  he had taken credit for my work with our boss.
Will you get to make it up?	I had a big fishing trip planned for this past weekend, but it got rained out.
I am sure you will find time	Doesn't seem like it. My job makes it very difficult to schedule time off.
Oh wow, how did he do	A friend of mine got to try out for a professional baseball team.
That is so cool	He made their minor league team, and if he does well, maybe the pro team.
That sounds like something that could really show off your talents.	Last week I had a big presentation at work, which I knew I was going to do well on.
That's great! Hope your hard work pays off.	I sure did, I had spent weeks learning the material, and really impressed my boss.
How expensive is that to go to?	I went to comic-con this year.. i felt like i was a child all over again
That is not too bad if you had a good time though	Depends on where you live. I spent 1000 bucks on it
The loss of a pet is heartbreaking. I know how you feel. How old was Trevor.	I felt so alone after my dog trevor passed last year
Life is hard. But remember he didn't die he went to his forever home.	He was 9.. his time hadn't come, but i guess life is that way sometimes..
Sorry to hear that.  Have you since been able to overcome your loneliness?	I was feeling so lonely in miami after i moved there
I understand feeling like a duck out of the pond.  Glad to hear you've made progress.	I think so.. i have made some friends. it was my first time being away from family
Don't feel nervous, you need to be confident!	I feel so nervous about my upcoming job interview
It's hard to push that feeling away sometimes, I know.	I know.. but i have this feeling inside me that i would screw up
That's exciting! I'm guessing you're a Lakers fan?	I am so hyped about Lebron  joining the Lakers!
What team was he on before?	Yeah i am! We finally have something that unite and rally us behind our team for a season
I understand that, I will pray for you	I am feeling so nervous about my dad getting his heart checked tomorrow
That makes sense, I wish you both the best of luck and health!	Thank you so much.. I am just hoping not to get any bad news
How old is he?	When i look at my son doing great in studies, it makes me so proud!
Wow, great job so far, kep up the great parenting!	He is 13. He has been a straight A student always.
Wasn't that out a long time ago? It must've been super scary if you still remember it.	I went to watch the Annabelle movie in the theatres. It was a terrifying experience
Wow, I wouldn't have been brave enough to do that!	Yeah, it has been a while. I went at night, alone. So you can imagine the impact!
Yes, it is hard to see people with things you can't afford to buy for yourself.	I always feel a bit of jealousy when i see someone driving around in a red sports car
Yes, I like the color red as well. I have actually own a couple red sports cars.	I feel that way about red sports car only though. I have always dreamed of owning one as a kid.
It is great to be thorough and prepared. Are you expecting to perform well?	I just took the last of my college finals and I stayed up all night studying the material.
Thats nice, i wish you the very best for your results!	I know I did well, I had the material all memorized and knew the answers to all the questions.
I can see why! That's highly inappropriate.	I was super irritated when my boss kept pulling my hair for fun!
You should. He is obviously at the very least flirting with you and at worst harassing you	He seems to think otherwise for some reason. I am thinking about reporting him to the HR.
Oh wow, that is going to be such a sweet experience!	I am going out to dinner with my wife to a place we haven't been to since I proposed to her. I cant wait.
That is very true. I sincerely wish you both to have a wonderful time!	I hope so. It ended up being the best restaurant we ever went to and it will be nice to rekindle out early romance.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have things of hers that remind you of her often?	I always feel down and blue when memories of my mom come in my mind.. she passed when i was 12
That is beautiful that you have those things of hers. Mothers are very special people.	Yeah.. i have kept a collection of her things, just so that she always stays in my life.
I have been to that, it is such a wonderful experience. You are going to love it!	I was so excited to go to Flower & Garden Festival at Epcot this year. I couldn't wait to try all the food and see the beautiful gardening.
You seem to have a great taste in spending your free time. I wish you get to have a splendid time in there!	I absolutely love going to Disney and the festivals at Epcot are such a great experience each time. We go to Food & Wine each year and the seminars are my favorite part! It's so exciting!
I'm sorry to hear about that. How did he die?	I was heartbroken when my dog trevor died last month..
yeah I bet. Im sorry for your loss	He was ran over by a truck.. I can't even try to imagine that
How did you hurt your back?	I hurt my back and can't mow the grass so it's getting long and everyone elses lawn look so nice. It's embarrassing.
Ohh wow! I hope it gets better for you	I really don't know. I woke up at it was tight then it just kept getting worse as day went on. Its been a week now.
Did you ask him to replace it?	A friend of mine borrowed my mower this past weekend, which he brought back broken.
I agree with you there, I would ask him to pay honestly	He said it wasn't his fault and it just stopped working. Of course the blade is bent, so I think he might be lying.
That's nice. How  do you like the dog?	My local animal shelter donated a dog to me because of my service connected disability. It was such a nice surprise
That is so sweet. My apartments don't allow pets	He is my best friend and I think he needs me as much as I need him.
That is for sure, especially a smell that just throws you back	I love when I go somewhere and for some reason or another it reminds me of my childhood. It makes me feel so good.
Exactly, sometimes I just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid, life is great sometimes	OMG yes! Sometimes it's a sound or just a feeling you get for no reason. It's like comfort food .lol
That stinks. Im sorry to hear that	I was suppose to go on vacation with my family last month, but I caught the flu and couldn't go.
I bet! It seems like fun	Yeah, I was looking forward to sitting on the beach and relaxing.
Congratulations. Fun plans?	I am celebrating me and my wife's 5 year anniversary tomorrow and I'm excited about it.
Awww. I'm jealous lol	Just going out to dinner and then a romantic night at the beach.
Awww. Did you keep it?	Years ago when we moved into our home, we found a young kitten that had been abandoned.
Thats great. I know he appreciates it	Yes, we did. He was so cute we took him in, and now he is 9 years old.
That's great. I hope you do well!	I feel very ready for my college exam.
Good luck!	Thank you. I think it will be easy!
how old was it	My rabbit died last year, I miss her to this day
they live that long ? interesting	I had her for about 10 years.
How'd that go?	So I asked my boss for a raise today.
Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.	It went well, I'm pretty sure that I'll get it!
That stinks. Maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve	So my neighbor just bought a new car. I swear, he always gets really expensive stuff to show off how successful he is.
Do it! I bet you deserve it	Maybe... but still. Now I feel like I need to buy one myself.
Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?	Last year my wife got into an accident and we only had one car and I was so worried we wouldn't have a car to get to work
Well I am glad it worked out	We didn't have many options but the other persons insurance ended up taking care of it all so we got a rental and the car got fixed but i was so scared .
What did you find?!	Last night I found something in my son's room that made me so mad!
Oh no, are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?	Drugs! I found drugs. I can't believe this.
Remind me, which show was that?	Do you remember that show I was telling you about the other day? It's getting a new season!
That's so cool!  I'm gonna have to check it out	The one with the three cops that can never agree with each other but end up solving the cases anyway. I'm so happy about this news!
That's nice. Are you going to hang it up?	I was going through some boxes today, and I found a really old picture of me with my grandmother.
Great, you've found an old treasure.	Yeah, definitely. It brings back really good memories.
I'm sorry. How long had you been together?	My girlfriend broke up with me recently...
Just try and get through each day, one at a time. Don't think too far ahead.	We were together for 3 years. I can't stand being alone.
That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?	I keep hearing noises coming from my basement...
If this were a movie, I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.	I want to, but I'm a bit scared. Maybe I should take something with me to defend myself, just in case.
I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?	I can't believe this! My son failed a really important test.
What test?	I sure hope so. Otherwise he might not be able to graduate.
That's great. Is that your only son?	They other day was my son's first day of school, and when I dropped him off it brought back so much memories.
I'm sure the memories will be great	Yes, he's my only son. I cant wait until he get's his first girlfriend like I did in middle school. Those were the days.
Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it	So I've been walking around all day with a huge hole in the back of my pants... I just found out about it.
Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes	If they did, no one told me about it! So embarrassing.
What is it called ?	So that new game that I've been looking forward to is coming out in a few weeks!
Okay, well I guess I'm happy for you then.	Oh, I'm sure it's not one that you've heard of. I'm pretty excited though, I've been saving up money for it for a few months now.
That's understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?	Yesterday, I caught my neighbor letting his dog poop on my lawn. I had a few choice words for him.
Oh, so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.	He wasn't to happy about me confronting him. I told him if it happens again it might get physical.
Did you find anything?	I was going through some boxes in my attic today.
I bet that was very nostalgic for you.	Yeah, I found some old toys from my childhood. So many memories came flooding back into my mind.
That's a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?	I can't believe that my coworker got the promotion that I was going for. This is ridiculous.
So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?	I honestly have no idea. I was definitely more deserving of that position.
What did you mess up?	I'm so ashamed of myself. I made a big mistake on a project for work.
I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?	It was something for an important client. Now I'm afraid this is going to screw up my career.
I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.	No, this is the first time I've messed up anything like this.
Wow, that's nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!	I bought a used car a few years ago and found 500 dollars tucked in the back seat!
I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have, lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!	Oh I spent it on a few things. I was just surprised someone didn't find it when it was being cleaned.
Well, it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.	I know! made it not so bad that the car I traded in was a junker and not worth much lol
How fun! In a tent or an RV?	I'm going camping with my kids this weekend.
Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!	In a tent. I just have to make extra sure that I pack all of the supplies that we'll need.
Ugh, that's so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?	On my way home today there was someone in the fast lane going so slow in front of me.
I hope you weren't late for anything important!	about 5 miles. there was too much trafic in the slow lane, couldn't get over
memory lane right there! which cartoons?	I was watching television earlier today when I came across a channel that was showing a bunch of cartoons that I loved when I was younger.
Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.	It was a whole bunch of different ones from the 90's. Man, they really reminded me of my childhood.
That would creep me out too what kind of calls??	I keep getting strange phone calls. It's creeping me out.
Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird.	The person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until I hang up. I'm not sure what I should do about it.
Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?	My boyfriend told me he quit drinking, but I just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room.
Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.	Absolutely, but it probably won't go well. He needs help but he won't accept it.
Congratulations, that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!	Yay! I'm finally getting a promotion at work!
Hope you treat yourself to celebrate, you deserve it!	Yeah, a raise will definitely come with it. I've put a lot of work into this, and it finally paid off!
That sounds amazing! When will you find out?	So I might be up for a promotion soon at work!
You sound positive so I am sure you will get it!!!	Soon. There are several other people trying to get the same position, but I'm pretty hopeful that things will work out in my favor.
omg, that's so scary! are you okay? did you call the police?	We went to get gas one night and my husband and an altercation with some guy, guy pulledoutabig knife in the storeand by our car at the gas station.
that's good to hear! people are crazy	yes we called the police he was arrested!
I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then	i envy my friend who is off work today
I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.	it definitely is
That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?	Ugh, my cat keeps climbing up the curtains in my room.
Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?	Yeah, he's tearing them up. I really wish he'd stop.
That is great! Adopt, don't shop! Always a great motto!	We've decided to adopt another cat from the shelter!
That is great, I commend you!	Agreed, that's my motto! This is a high-kill shelter too, so we'll definitely be saving a life :)
Have you prepared enough for it?	i am nervous for a meeting i have later
Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.	yeah i believe so
That's good to hear! Have you been eating healthy?	im happy with my health for the first time in a few years
That's great! Keep up the good work!	yes definitely, and getting plenty of exercise
thats strange, my dog will eat anything lol	I bought some new food for my dog, and he refuses to eat it.
maybe he will start warming up to it soon	Yeah, that's what I thought about mine too. I bought a huge bag of the stuff, too. It's so irritating.
About what?!	My coworker gave a really nice presentation at work today.
That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.	Oh it was just boring work stuff, about a client. But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.
thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return	I've been working hard and doing a great job for several months, but still no raise.
Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier!	Yeah, especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit!
Did you study for it or are you winging it?	im nervous about taking a test soon
Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!	i feel pretty prepared
Maybe you should try and have a party?	My roommate is gone for the week, on a business trip. It's way too quiet around here.
Yes being alone is not very fun.	That's a good idea. I can't stand being alone in this place much longer.
What will your new age be?	My birthday is coming up next week. I'm really looking forward to it.
You should have a great time, congrats on the new age!	I'll be turning 35. And some friends are coming that I haven't seen in years, it'll be great to see them again.
I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?	My wife and I got a divorce. The house is so quiet without her and the kids being here.
If your depressed, speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change, that comes in time.	About two years now and everything still seems very odd to me.
Why is it that you are in trouble?	Uh oh. I'm in trouble now.
Can you just replace the document?	I lost a really important document at work... telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing.
I would be reporting that to the police for sure.	"There's a creepy guy that comes by at work that won't stop bothering me. He writes crazy letters, and keeps calling on the phone ""just to chat"" with me."
Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane.	I tried. They said they can't do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me, which is insane to me.
Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.	My father was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer.
I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.	Yes it was. It only took a few short months and my father passed away due to it being inoperable.
That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?	I'm starting a new job next week! Can't wait to be doing something different for a change!
Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place, you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.	Thanks! Graphic design mostly. At my old job I was a manager and it was horrible.
Aw man, that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?	Recently, I got passed over for a promotion at my job.
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!	No, the guy that got it was qualified, it's just I really wanted the job. It would have really help my career.
That is amazingly lucky! good for you!	I bought a scratch off lottery ticket the other day, and won $5000.
That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!	I almost passed out, I have never won so much money before.
Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he?	Had to take my cat to the vet. He's got a bad injury on his paw and it hasn't been healing.
Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :(	He's 8 years old. They're going to have to put him down - turns out he has feline aids :(
I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it?	One of my art pieces has been chosen to be put in a exhibition!
Hopefully! that would be so amazing!	Haven't been paid for it yet, but people that visit are welcome to put in an offer for anything they see! Fingers crossed someone wants mine!
That sounds like such a fun, peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool, it's been scorching outside!	I was enjoying the morning watching the kids play in the pool.
Ah okay, nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)	Well it's only a kiddie pool, kids are very little. It was a very nice morning.
Aw, well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.	As a child, I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it.
Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.	True, but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today, but I never can take those things back.
I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?	my husband and i lostour daughter 2years ago and i don't care to celebrate mother's day and he still impressed me with a gift
That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.	he got my favorite flower, an orchid a card and made dinner
Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself.	Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1,000 miles, and I felt like such a fool.
Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol	Agreed, and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!
Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?	My cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night. I still can't figure out how he did it.
Well at least you managed to save him!	He is! Well, both smart and dumb haha. Had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!
Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?	I've got a coworker with zero social skills, and it's driving me batty. She can't seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for 30 minutes straight.
That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.	If you make a comment on anything, say cats, she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).
Did it feel good to get it out?	We had an annoying client the other day, and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).
Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?	It did at first, until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! It was humiliating and I felt really bad for her after that.
That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.	I found some baby kittens in my yard, their mother was dead. I nursed them to health and found homes for them.
Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!	They are my favorite, too. I love how independent they are.
I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.	Finances aren't great right now. I've got a lot of bills that are overdue, but I can't afford to pay them :(
Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.	I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks, and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.
You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!	I was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test
Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!	I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off
Oh no, I am so sorry. What did you do?	A few years back I got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money. It broke me, I really loved that job.
That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?	To be honest, I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.
Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?	im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night
I hope you all have some fun.	about a year and a half!
Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!	I'm SO ready for fall - it's been incredibly hot all summer, and I need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!
It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!	Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters, snuggling up with a hot drink, and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!
Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.	A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.
Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!	Thanks for the tip, I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!
That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.	I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have.
It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.	Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages, but it's been stressful ever since.
oh that was nice of them	My friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that I didn't know about.
haha thats pretty fun	Yeah, they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?	I have an adorable hamster that doesn't look like he's doing well. He is on the old side for hamsters, and I'm worried he won't live much longer.
Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!	Thank you, me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him, but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.
That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!	I went back to work for my former company recently. They laid me off a few years ago when things were tough. Coming back was a little scary but I was thrilled!
I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!	Yes, that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.
That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?	im upset that my neighbor's dog is sick
Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?	no they are at the vet now
Oh no, what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!	Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day, great dinner, concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan...
Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!	Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!
Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?	My neighbor has a brand new Tesla and every time I look at it I get so envious. I know it's stupid, I should be happy for him that he has such a cool car.
You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.	Well that's the thing, I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit.
lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!	That is a really good way to put it, I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.
Exactly!	A Tesla with a bike rack!
oh thats nice	I'm happy my package just arrived
yea i would be to	im glad it came earlier
Why's that?	I'm feeling nostalgic today
Nostalgia is a weird feeling.	I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier
Nice, what do you have planned?	I've got a fun weekend coming up, and I'm really looking forward to it!
Sound great, I'm happy for you!	Going to the drive-in, out to eat, and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special, just haven't had fun in awhile!
Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!	I recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!
Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.	It felt amazing to be recognized for my work, and in a publication I respect to boot!
What are some things you will bring?	I am going to Disney next year. I want to write a list of everything to bring.
It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.	I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.
What is wrong? Are you okay?	Things have been rough for me lately, but thankfully I've got family and a fiance that are helping me through it.
I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.	I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs, and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/
We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.	the rain today is frustrating
Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.	im not a fan of it at all
Oh my goodness, I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!	The other day I was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign, nearly hitting me. Thank goodness I was paying attention and was able to stop in time.
Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!	I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.
Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?	My boyfriend proposed to me, and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise.
Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.	Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year, but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!
I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.	I just had my birthday and I ate WAY too much. Had a good time, but boy do I feel bad for all of that food. I'm supposed to be eating healthier!
Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.	No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too, and how could I say no to that?
Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.	i am pleased with the day im having today
That is true. It puts things in context.	me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad
That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that.	Every night before bed, we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life.
It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook.	It is. And shows that he is listening.
that is frustrating, especially if the weather isnt ideal	Our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby.
that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!	Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.
That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?	My friend left my front door open when she was house-sitting for me. My cat snuck out and was killed.
Are you going to get another cat?	I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.
I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!	I can't wait for it to be Christmas already. Just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy.
I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!	Exactly! And the food, and friends. All of it is just so lovely.
That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.	Each day waking up I can't believe how lucky am I just to be alive.
That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.	Yes, I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.
8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!	I went running for the first time in months. I could not believe it. I was able to run a full 8 miles with out taking a break.
Have you been a long time runner before that?	Yes, my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.
I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!	Just gave my wife access to my credit card. I'm worried but excited I can trust her. Do you ever have issues trusting people?
Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?	It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.
That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?	I've been at my current job 5 years. I'm at the point I can go into upper management but I'm afraid. Maybe I'm just comfortable now. I don't know. ,5|5|5_5|5|5,
Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.	An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA, I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well.
Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?	I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.
Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!	I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves, Color me impressed!
Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!	Yes,  I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.
awesome! what kind?	A friend of mine bought a new car
oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat	Tesla, I've had my eye on the model for some time
That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?	A friend of mine got a new high paying job
That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.	I thought it was amazing he got it, seemed like a tough job to land
Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?	A co-worker of mine was late delivering materials for a project
That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.	The guy just doesn't seem to care
It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.	Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit.
I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.	I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.
Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!	im scared of this big test tomorrow
Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!	yes i have, still nervous though
Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that.	My wife and I are on a diet together for the last month. We have been doing great but today on my way home from work I stopped for Ice cream and did not tell her.
It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!	Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow.
You only get to do it once?	I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing.
Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.	Yes, you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.
Congrats!	I finally got a raise at my job
Was it more than expected?	I was pretty happy, it was long overdue
That has happened to me, but with texts though lol	The other day I was drinking and sent an email I shouldn't have. I felt so stupid when I woke up and realized what I'd done.
Did you apologize?	Yeah I've done that, too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.
LOL	No, when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!
what's wrong with it?	My car has been having issues lately
can you fix it?	Engine issues I think, not sure if the car will make it
That is great news. Have you also been working out?	Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds.
Has it been easy or hard to do that?	Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.
did they notice it was missing?	I took some candy a friend left out
well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.	Not yet, I plan on compensating my friend for what I took
Ohh wow! Are you excited?	I just realized today I have not been home to where my family is from in a little over 10 years.
Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though	No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.
That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?	The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint.
Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all.	Yeah that's what made it weird, it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.
Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.	A close friend said she was having problems with her knee
Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!	Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it
I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?	A co-worker stole my lunch
Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone.	Not entirely sure, I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs
What did you do?	A friend of mine revealed a deep dark secret I told her in confidence to everyone.
You definitely can't be too careful these days	I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.
how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?	Every single time I go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something. If I don't go to the bathroom no one comes in all day.
ok	Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.
Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.	I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet.
Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.	It's funny you say that, I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy, which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.
Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!	I got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that's higher than I usually charge.
Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it.	Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.
What! First of all, are you alright?	Someone hit my car and fled the scene
Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though.	Yeah, I'm fine, the car was parked
That's great. Do they know?	'm promoting two staff members on Sunday. They work hard and are great people.
Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either	They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me.
I have never run a marathon	'm running my first Marathon Sunday. I'm scared that maybe I did not train hard enough.
You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one	No better time to try then now.
Well that's some sort of motivation lol	I will not run If I can't finish. I'm stubborn I'll finish or kill over.
Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?	Just finished my Master's degree now time to take on a PhD
Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?	Astrophysics
Have you tried to talk to your teacher?	I start my last year of my Masters program Friday. I'm scared I feel like I'm all ready behind.
What school is this you are talking about?	No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known, it's one of the hardest schools to get into.
That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.	I spent all summer getting ready to write my thesis. I can't wait to get time to start.
Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40,000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!	I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor.
I can understand that.	I love to be snuggled up with attention and time with my boyfriend when he doesn't I get sad and jealous.
You must love him very much, that's good.	I know he has to spend time with others but I get envious I want every minute spent together I'm spoiled lol.
Aw, it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time	I'm at a new school and I won't have any friends
The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!	Yes, but how do I even talk to people I don't know?
that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore	I felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries
same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you	Yeah thats true most people don't.  I love helping those in need it's a great feeling
Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.	I can't believe I didn't get that promotion at work :(
Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough.	Agreed, it's a popularity contest!
Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you	My wife cheated on me! It's absurd!!
I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds	Thank you, what should I do about it?
Did she say thank you?	I was very happy last week helping an elderly women bag her groceries
What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!	Yes she did thank me
That's the worst! What did you do?	Ugh, my neighbor's dogs wouldn't stop barking this morning!
That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!	Well I'll tell you what I didn't do. I didn't go back to sleep, due to the noise. I think I'm going to have a word with him later.
Yeah, those were better times. Brings back good memories.	Remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? I miss it.
Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.	Maybe we can relive such times through our children.
Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?	I don't understand why people come to work to just not do their jobs I have a coworker like this.
I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.	We are on the same page I have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it's like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work.
sounds like you ate a delicious dessert, what did you eat?	The desert was incredible! The taste! The look! The feel as I ate it!
that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert	It was chocolate ice cream dipped in crushed cookies, marshmallows, and chocolate sauce which had frozen to a crisp!
O? That's a brave and noble decision.	I think I'm going to move my mother into my house with us.
That's hard but great of you to do, good luck.	Yeah, she's been pretty sick lately. I want to make sure she's here where she can get all of the care that she needs.
Where will you be shopping?	I'm going shopping tomorrow, it'll be so much fun!
Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?	I think I'll go to Costco and Walmart.
hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing	I'm so sad, my avocado was moldy this morning!
did you still eat it? or did you throw it away	It really is! :(
That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them	My family is the best they through me a surprise birthday party.
Well, I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care	I was amazed they even did that but very grateful I haven't had anything in a while also so you wasn't alone your family will do something and you will enjoy it.
Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?	i was shocked when i found out my wife cheated on me
It depends, if you love her, you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too	Im not sure what should i do though ?
O yea? I	My friend taught his dog some tricks. It's really fun to watch!
I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!	It's amazing how quickly the dog responds to the commands. My friend must really know what he's doing.
I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.	I was taking an important test in one of my classes the other day... I'm ashamed to say that I cheated.
That's your decision to make, but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.	Yeah... I'm thinking about coming clean about it to my professor before he finds out on his own.
That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?	My wife and I are going out to one of my favorite restaurants tonight.
I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.	Not really, just felt like going out. I'm thinking about ordering something I haven't had before, but.... I don't know. I'm weird about trying new foods.
you must be loving it	I bought a used car a couple months ago and I have to say it's holding up really well for a 6 year old car. It's like new.
true that, you cant be too sure until you use it	I am, You never know what shape a used car really is until you have it for a while.
Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?	I have a performance review coming up at work in a couple of weeks.
Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem	Oh yeah. I'm pretty sure the review is going to go well. I might even get a raise!
Oh no! That has so happened to me before! It was only by a couple dollars a month but I SO needed those couple of dollars at the time. I would be MAAADDD	I just got notice that my mortgage payment has gone up this year and i'm so mad about it.
Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! That's got to be so annoying for you!	I am, it went up 20 dollars.
I buy those like twice a year and never win.	I don't play the lottery, ever, but a friend recently gave me a scratch off ticket.
Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it?	I won $200!
Hey, why not? It's unexpected money!	I blew it on online video games, lol.
Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.	That is always the best kind.  I still won't be buying lottery tickets, lol.
Where was she?	My girlfriend and I were at a party Friday night. I couldn't find her anywhere, and got worried.
Does she have a new ex now?	In a spare bedroom with her ex, laying on the bed and kissing him.
I would not put up with it either	She sure does. I am not putting up with that, lol.
i love when the rain his the soil in the open field , the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing	I love the rain.  It makes everything feel fresh.
I bet you are. What are you going to do?	im stoked to go to the park later today
sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it	take my dog to the park and meet up with some friends!
Why is that	i felt bad about sleeping in today
You will be alright buddy	i fell behind on things i needed to get done
What have you done this year if you dont mind me asking?	i feel like a have accomplished a lot this summer
That is great, well there is still time to go this year!	ive gotten a lot of work done and spent time with friends and family
I love it when it's nice out. Are you going to do something outside?	i am happy about the beautiful weather today
That sounds great. A nice long walk in perfect weather. There's hardly anything better.	yes, im going to the park later this afternoon!
Are you excited for him or jealous? lol	My brother just bought a new car...
I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his.	Well, I can't help but feel like he only did it to make me feel inferior.
Can you report the caller?	I got a threatening phone call... and now I'm scared.
Be sure to do it, otherwise they could keep harassing you	I should be able to. I recognized the voice, it's someone that I used to know.
What class is it for?	i have studied and i am ready to take my test soon
I never took chemistry. Do you feel prepared for the test?	chemistry
That's great.  Have they always been as supportive as they are now	i am thankful for my supportive family
nice.  what do you do for a living	yes i have been very fortunate
Have you thought about spraying your garden?	I went out to the garden and there were a ton of mosquitoes, I couldn't even do any gardening.
Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try	I thought about it but they were coming from the grass around it and I'm worried the dog would get sick if I sprayed the grass
Same here, I'm in Texas.  Where are you located	i was shocked how nice the weather has been the past couple days
Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here	in the midwest!
Were you able to get inside fast?	I was mowing the lawn today and it started storming out of nowhere!
Oh wow! That would be annoying!	No. I was in the middle of the yard and it was sunny, next thing I know it's pouring down rain and I'm soaked.
How did they get off work midweek?	im envious of my friends who are off work today
That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.	thats just their normal schedule
where is your favorite place to go?	We go on vacation once a year as a family.
i can imagine, i hope you have a great time this year	I just love going, when it gets closer to when we are leaving I look forward to it.
I remember when my first child started, I was a nervous wreck.	My son starts kindergarten soon. He is my first one.
So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow, that's crazy.	They sent out an email saying that he may end up with a substitute teacher until they hire someone.
Have you tried getting out and meeting new people?	I have no friends and I am lonely
What about online friends?	No, it is difficult to meet people in my area because I like in a farm. I only talk to the animals
that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?	My friends went to dinner without me
i totally understand that. i'm sorry.	I'm fine, just disappointed mostly
That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?	I woke up and my car had a flat tire
That is good to hear.	No, but I was able to get it towed easily enough
That's understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?	A co-worker was having issues finishing a project
That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!	It was a major work project, I stepped in to help him
That's okay, I'm 25 and still in college. How did it go for you?	I was really apprehensive about going to university at the age of 30.
That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)	It went pretty well! I got great grades and made friends despite the age difference.
Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm	Once I was stranded hours from home in a snowstorm. I ended up going to a stranger's house to wait it out
Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there	Well, she was really nice and we had been waiting together in the snow for awhile, so I felt I could trust her.
Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?	I was looking at advertisements of my childhood toys recently and felt strangely overwhelmed with emotion.
I have absolutely no idea what Boglins are, but I'm sure they were awesome!	Yes! Especially the ads for toys I haven't thought of in years, like Boglins.
Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?	Once when I was a kid I got caught in a riptide with my sister. It was very scary!
That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?	Yes, Martinique Beach in Nova Scotia. The currents are very strong.
Great to hear that you made it out ok!	Yes that's right! I was a strong swimmer so we made it.
Well, I can understand that. It's very hard to be on a very strict diet, without a break here and now!	I suppose to be on a committed diet but I kind of cheated today.
Well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard, I know!	It is my coworkers said they was going to Burger King and I couldn't resist I feel so bad and guilty.
Is this a career change?	I been out of school for about 5 years I am finally going back to college.
Oh hey, I'm a nursing graduate! It'll be difficult at first, but you'll get the hang of it.	Yes I am going for nursing I can't wit I am over joyed going to be hard work but I got this.
Aw, that sucks. Did you give her a proper burial?	We lost our faily dog she had been with us since I was 15 years old.
Awwww, I am so sorry. Have you thought about getting a new pup?	Yes we did my mom loved her so much especially when me and my brither moved out she is hurt and down so bad.
Yea, a new job is useless pretty stressful.	Starting a new job can be different on my first day last month I can say that was me.
It will be ok in the end.	I would say I was more nervous then anything I think the new setting was over whelming but a month later I feel a lot better now.
Oh that is a real bummer. Were you hurt?	I had a car accident the other day!
Ok glad you did not get injured. I hope your car gets fixed.	Yeah it was! No luckily nobody got hurt thanks. The worst part was actually having to talk to the insurance company
Sorry to hear that	I got divorced a few years agi
Well that's good. You never know what to say in that situation	Thanks, it's ok though! It got settled and i'm happy
I wish yo the best	Yeah I know what you mean! It was hard at the time but i'm a lot happier for it now
That must of been fun to go through.	I was clearing out my attic recently and came accross an old suitcase stuffed full of all my childhood toys, medals, school reports, photos etc!
That is cool. Is your mother still alive?	It was brilliant.  My mum must have gathered it up over the years.  I spent hours going through it all.  it made me feel so nostalgic.  I think its a great idea though, I might start doing it for my kids.
What was?	Man that was hard to deal with today.
Really? Did you manage to cope?	I had a lull in work and the store was empty, and there was nobody in there for an hour.  I was about to go insane.
And was there?	First it was just boring then I started to actually get pretty lonely.  I saw if there was something I could read while I waited.
Good	Yeah there was a magazine or two.  I got by
im sorry to hear that	My 19 year old cat died recently. I was devastated.
you ever ever plan to get another ?	Thanks. I still think about him all the time.
Really, how did they do it?	You know I have a friend that has a very successful business that he started with only a few thousand dollars
Amazing! Well done to him.	They started an irrigation sprinkler business with just a few contracts and its blown up and now he's handling large companies
Well done, at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now	I figured out why my air conditioner wasn't working earlier. I was very pleased with myself.
Heat wave is getting so terrible theses days. I even watched on CNN that the whole of New South Wales is experiencing a drought, so sad	Exactly. It was so dang hot today, too.
That sounds unfortunate. You must have been so annoyed with him!	I kept getting stuck behind an irritating man while grocery shopping yesterday. He was so loud and always in my aisle.
People like that should just do shopping online instead of ruining the experience for everyone else!	I was! He had an uncanny knack of blocking me and taking up the whole width of the aisle.
Do you have daughters of your own?	When I see little homeless girls I feel like a father.
Why is that?	No I do not, and probably never will.
yea traffic sucks	I was stuck in traffic the other day for so long, when it was supposed to be clear.
well yea thats true	Unless there is good music playing.
Same here. It reminds me of my childhood for some reason.	When I go for a walk in autumn, it brings up some good memories.
Exactly, i am overcome with nostalgia and get tears of joy sometimes.	Yes, the smell especially.
I bet! Did it turn out nice?	Last year I hardly could hide my impatience to go on vacation.
That's good... I can't wait for my vacation!	Yes, I had a good time.
That's terrible! Did the dog survive?	I've seen a kid beet up a dog once, it got me very angry.
Maybe someone should train the kid to be stronger... by beating him up!	Yes, the dog turned out to be fine, kid said he was training he her to be stronger.
What I do is to write all the good things I did within the week, I think you should do the same	Sometimes I feel like I am really an alright person.
i agree with you buddy	it's a good idea, but we should also write our mistakes, to not repeat them in the future.
You must have prepared really well. Did the trip go well?	My last vacation we went to Florida and a lot of prep work went into getting everything ready
Sounds like the trip went well. I am glad you enjoyed it!	yes the plane ride was smooth and no delay's and we got a nice rental van
all the time	Have you know somebody growing up who was supposed to become a great human being, but they turned out something else?
its just life	I really wonder why this things happen.
Nice, what breed is the puppy?	You know recently we got a new puppy he's a goldendoodle and is a lot of fun
I have never heard of such a breed. Must be so cute!	he's a goldendoodle which is a poodle and golden retriever mixed
i do that all the time. i live on the mexican border. what border did you cross?	I had to cross the border once with very few pages in my passport once.
glade all was well	I think I was flying to Philippines, but they let me in, which was a relief.
Cool! How did it go?	last week i attended a job interview with tesla
Great! I hope you get the job. I'll be rooting for you!	it went well above my expectations
He sounds pretty strong. Any reason in particular that he did that?	While I was eating dinner last week, my wife and I watched a guy pick up the rear end of a newer pick up truck.
No kidding. Definitely some quality entertainment for dinner time!	My guess would be because he was drunk. It was still quite the sight to see.
That must be so exciting!	So my wife and I after saving all year are going on our first vacation together next month.
I hope you both have a great time!	My wife is so happy. She has never seen the ocean before.
oh how does it go	I went on an interview for a job.
its ok you tried your best	I thought I did pretty well because I practiced days in advance, looked up information and everything, but I didn't get it.
Well that is great and sad all at the same time. How far away did she move?	one month back my sister got married and she shifted to another state along with her husband
Aw well that is normal. I'm sure she didn't want to leave. Every day will get a little easier.	we live in texas she moved to newyork area, since then i am missing her presence in the home and feeling little low
Oh my goodness, that sounds terrifying.	Last year during a bad storm, a tornado touched down right across the street from our house.
I'm glad that you are okay.	It was. We were in the basement and it sounded like a freight train was going over the house.
i bet that was quite the blast from the past	My family and I recently moved, and we found a box of our oldest child's baby toys from 12 years ago.
yes they do. mine are already out of college	It was!  It was a bit bittersweet, though. They grow up too fast.
Oh, are you going on a trip?	We packed up everything in the car to go visit my family.
That sounds like a fun time.	We went on vacation to see my family in another state. I was very happy to be going.
That is so nice of them!	Last month for my 20th anniversary at my job, my coworkers threw me a party.
I am so happy for you! Congrats!	I had no idea till I walked into the office with my boss on lunch. I was completely shocked.
Really?	I recently spent a full weekend relaxing at the beach.
That's fun	Yeah.  It was great to get away from work and family pressures for just a bit, and to enjoy some peace and quiet.
Oh no! I'm so sorry! It's so difficult to lose a pet.	Last month, my cat Sam passed away. He was 14 years old.
I hope in time you are able to feel better.... and that your heart will be filled with happy memories.	He was more than a pet, he was truly my best friend.
That's awesome! Happy belated birthday! What did she get you?	last week i had my birthday and my wife presented astonished me with her gift
Sweet! I really like Ducati's they are beautiful bikes.	she presented me my dream bike its ducati
Did it rain a lot?	Last week, there was a front move through our area that produced many very powerful storms.
That must be really scary to go through.	It really did. Also, there were over 20 confirmed tornado touch downs in my county alone.
That sounds like fun! What happened?	I was going to a pumpkin patch with my sister in law, and I let her drive my car.
Yeah- I understand that. I don't let anyone drive my car, either. I hope everything worked out okay!	I wasn't feeling good so she drove, but she drives kind of fast. Usually I don't let anyone drive my car.
That seems like it would be a little awkward to me..	A stranger bought me groceries last Sunday. I only know them through an online forum.
Well, they sound like they are actually just a nice person trying to help you out, that is really nice.	They saw a post I'd made about losing my job and messaged me. I'm going to embroider them something as thanks.
That's always a nice find.	I was cleaning out the attic and found a bunch of old photo albums.
I bet it was! I love looking at photo albums	Yes it was. It was really great seeing all of those fun times with my family from the past.
That is nice. Did you start playing guitar with him?	I have a buddy who decided to take up playing guitar a few years ago.
That is good.	I tried, lol.  I recently heard him play for the first time in over a year.  His skill levels astounds me.
I am also working from home from time to time. I could feel some time lonely.	I work from home and sometimes it makes me a bit sad to know that I'm here alone.
I usually get out after finishing work to feel less lonely.	I'm sorry to hear you are in the same boat sometimes. Do you have any advice on how to make it feel less lonely?
Oh, that must have been so embarrassing.	Once on my way to work I slipped and fell after I got off the bus and everyone stared at me. I laid there until the bus drove away because I felt so humiliated.
I'm sorry it happens to us at times.	The sad thing is I do stuff like that all the time :(
Congratulations! That is so cool!	I stopped at a gas station on the way to work last week and got gas and a scratch off ticket and won $500.
I hope you have fun with that money.	Yes, it's the most money I  have ever won on a lottery ticket. It was very shocking.
I can't believe your coworker would do that to you! Did your manager listen?	Last week, one of my coworkers took credit for a job I had completed. I had to get to the manager to get things straightened out.
I wouldn't be either. Are you going to try to talk to your coworker about it?	Yes he did. He knew that the other guy had been at a different job site, I will still not very happy about the situation.
OH wow! I bet you all had a blast!!	School starts back next week so last weekend I took my girls to Disney World.
They will really appreciate that when they are older and look back on it.	Yes we did they loved it it was such a thrill and the shows and rides was so fun.
oh god, what do you do at that time	Last spring, it rained so much my basement ended up flooding.
how did you feel at that time	Well, I did my best to save what I could. A lot of irreplaceable things were destroyed however, photos among other things.
Oh wow! Are the babies ok?	I was out in the yard and I found a rabbits nest with a bunch of babies in it right in the middle of the yard!
Good thinking. I'm sure the parent bunnies appreciated that.	They are fine. I put some tree branches over it to give it some protection from predators and the elements
Oh man. What a bummer!  I love cucumbers and hummus!  Do you have anything else you're growing that survived?	All my cucumber plants died this week due to too much rain
Oh good, I'm glad the entire garden didn't get ruined.  I would love to plant a garden one day soon since I went vegan plant based about 3 months ago.  Happy tomato eating to you!	My tomatoes and peppers are doing really well for starters.
Oh what a mess. I would hope that they picked it up.	the neighbor's trash can had blown over and there was garbage all over the road
Well at least they cleaned up after. I would have been more annoyed if they didnt.	they did as soon as they got home and saw it
Could you tell me what you have done?	im happy with what all i have accomplished this summer
That sounds great, I hope you succeed.	i put a lot of work into my small business im starting and spent a lot of time with friends a family so far
That's great news! Congrats! My garden is not doing great this year. Do you grow anything else?	I'm so happy, My jalapeno plants are producing so many peppers.
Yum. I wish I had a green thumb.	I grow a few other things. Green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, melons, and a few other things
That's awesome, It is very hot where I live, so I am jealous!	i couldnt believe how beautiful the weather was when i woke up today
Well I'm glad you get to enjoy some nice weather for a change!	it has been really hot here too
where exactly are you cos it rained all through in my area?	i was shocked at how bright and sunny it is today
ok im at the south east	midwest
ohh wow! That's not cool	Last week in the middle of the night, someone drove off the road and took out a large section of my fence around my yard.
I wish people would take responsibilities for their own actions	They didn't stick around or anything and it's going to be pretty expensive to have it all replaced.
Oh man! Hopefully nothing broke!	i dropped my grocery bag in the parking lot and it spilled everywhere
At least it sounds like you recovered everything!	nope but i did have to chase down a few cans that rolled away lol
He accused me of stealing from him	i felt bad when i cut someone off in traffic this morning
Sorry, that was an error! Any way over to your conversation.Who did you cut off that made you feel bad?	who did
Yea I hear ya. Im stuck here at work for another day too.	im envious of everyone who is outside enjoying the sun right now
I just hope it doesnt rain this weekend.	same here, but the weekend will be fun
What is the test on? Have you prepared for it? I bet you will do better than you think!	im worried about an upcoming test
Good for you! I bet you will do amazing. Best of luck!	yes i have studied quite a bit, thank you!
i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse. i've never been brave enough to go eat alone.	I have no friends. One time I went into a restaurant and ate by myself. Everyone laughed
i get that. i work all day then come home to the same routine everyday.	Yes, that is why I am in front of my computer all day.
Me too! I'm stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there.	i envy everyone outside right now enjoying the weather
Haha, same! Just one more hour for me. Hope you can enjoy it soon!	im looking out the window waiting to go out lol
That is not good, what happened	A good co-worker of mine lost his job
That is never a good thing, I hope they land on their feet	His boss felt he was under-performing.  It's a shame because he was fun to work with
How did they do that?	A co-worker of mine was able to complete a complicated project quickly
Oh, well that is a nice surprise though!	He was more skilled than I thought
That is nasty, how do they get away with that?	I get so mad when workers don't wash their hands in restaurants I had this happen to me recent I left the place immediately.
Exactly, I would report them, so nasty	Right I was so sicken I said yes this will be the last time I go to this Pizza Hut it's like would you want someone to do you and your food that way.
How so?	My car has been acting strange lately
I hope so too, get it checked out!	Strange noises and grinding, I hope it doesn't break down
Sorry to hear that. It would really upset me to be in that situation!	I bought a scratch lottery ticket for $20 and didn't win anything
I hope you win that one! Good luck!	Thanks, I will buy another one!
I am sorry for your loss, at least you got some time together	My granddad means so much to me I still wear his necklace even though he passed.
I feel that way about my grandma, it is sad that by the time we are born they are so old	Yes and thank you I know he is close in spirit I get emotional sometimes but the memories we had was great.
I think lyft is better	I thought the service Uber was good but I had a bad experience today was so upset.
I would hate that	I'll have to try them my Panera was over a hour late and my lunch was over once it arrived.
Where to?	A close friend of mine is moving away
oh, I am sorry to hear that, why did they move away?	Out of state, it's a shame because we were good friends
They sounds very complicated	A friend of mine was able to build this complicated desk in a few hours
That is nice to have	He's very talented with tools, it'd probably take anyone else half a day at least
having friends over is always nice!	A friend of mine is coming to visit
i bet. hope you all have a fantastic time!	Yeah, he's a good friend, it'll be a lot of fun when he arrives
How do you feel about that?	A friend who I hadn't seen since school started work at my job
Are you guys in good relations?	He was the last person I expected to see
did it bring back a lot of old mermories?	I found some old school papers of mine
thats good that you have progressed	Yeah, I've come a long way
She is a crappy person, flirting with someone who is in a relationship. Good on you- stand up guy	A co-worker has been flirting with me at work.  I turned her down though since I have a girlfriend
Lol- Well poor you. I have always had guys doing the same and it means nothing to me. If I am in a relationship..or heck even when I am not..I don't get interested in random people generally. I have to know who someone is..Remember that- what lasts is WHO someone is...Someone you want to grow old with..Bodies won't last.	It's been hard though, I've had many girls interested in me lately
That must of been weird. Who was it?	One time while I was waking up in the middle of the night, I saw a little girl sitting beside my bed
Was it suppose to scare you?	It was a doll someone put next to me
thats awesome	I have been faithful to my relationship with my boyfriend
Well I hope it lasts forever	yah, we are always happy
That's good! I guess you studied a lot?	i have an exam in the next month and am prepared for it
That's good. I am sure you will do great on it.	yah, been studying for a while now.
Ouch, that sounds pretty gross!	i took a taxi and the driver was sneezing right to my side
I'd avoid that taxi driver again if you have the chance.	yah, it felt so distigusting
I hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up.	Imagine,i started working out two months ago,only to weigh myself and i have gained some weight
Yes, don't let that stop you. Also pay attention to what you eat as well. It's even more important than the exercise portion.	I hope so,i  got a little discouraged.But i will keep working out
I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing. Which is it?	I've been feeling pretty wholesome recently.
That's great! It's definitely a good thing when you can be yourself.	It's good, I just meant that I can be by myself and feel alright.
What was it I wonder?	About a week ago on the way home I smelt something so bad that it made me anxious.
It must've been nasty like puke	I don't even want to remember that smell.
I like that philosophy. Here lately, has it been easier or harder to stay positive?	I always try to stay positive no matter what.'
I like that, how long have you felt this way about life?	Let's put it that way, even when it's harder I still remain positive.
wow, its good to warm	Anytime the weather is sunny I feel happy.
it is easier to walk around when its sunny also	Yes, warmth is better than cold.
What exactly did he do>	am so frustrated by the police officer who tried to harass me
Yes, some people have to stay away form law enforcement jobs.	he tried to take my Driving licence by force on over speeding claims which was not true
Wow! I bet you two are very excited!	Next month my wife and I are going on vacation to Hawaii.
That is wonderful. Our first vacation after getting married was full of fun, sun and adventure. Those are the best!	We are, it will be our first vacation together since we got married.
You sound very confident. That's good	I damn certain sure this time round i will pass my statistics retake exam
I know what you mean. Just believe in yourself	I can't imagine getting a fail for a second time.
Is he being too noisy?	Last week my neighbor began making renovations on his home.
I see how that can be annoying, have you asked him to stop doing that?	Yeah, that's the problem. On weekends he likes to start hammering and sawing at 5am.
You weren't excited about it?	The day that I got accepted into nursing school was just an ordinary day.
I understand. Stress is a definite mood killer	Well I had been waiting for weeks and was unaware, but at the end of a stressful day I checked my mail and the letter came in to let me know if I got in or not.
ive always wanted to have the eye surgery. im ready to get rid of my glasses and contacts	I had an eye surgery recently now I am anxiously waiting for perfect vision.
im glad you feel happy about it	Just do I already know it the best thing I've done for my body.
It's good to believe in good things.	i have hope for the future
Yes, I like your attitude.	that's right in the end everything will be fine
it's true there's nothing like the good old days	Any time a hear a sound of a fun I become reminiscent of good old times.
i'm glad you were one of them!	Of course, only for the people that lived through them
I know how you feel. Do you have a big trip planned once you receive your passport?	I applied for a new passport now I am waiting for it, how it gets here soon.
I hope you enjoy your adventures!	Yes, I have some big plans to fill those blank pages.
I hear you. I had the same experience after just 5 years	Last year, my wife and I got a divorce after being married 8 years.
I understand. She took my daughter with her	It was so strange without her and the kids here at the house.
What subject are you trying to pass?	i have an exam soon i believe i'm gonna do great in it
I love math, good luck with your exams than.	maths
why were you acting like that?	I was acting like a arrogant peacock today.
i'm glad you were in a good mood.	I don't know, woke up in too good of a mood I guess.
Did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?	A few days ago I've met a couple of people that got me feeling negative things, even though I don't even know them.
I understand how that can make you feel a certain way. Unfortunately, there are those types of people around every corner.	Not really, maybe just a bit, it's how they said it I guess.
Oh Wow! 20 years at your job! You must be well liked there.	Last week at work, my coworkers threw me a 20th anniversary party at our company office.
It must have been a wonderful surprise for you.	I like to think I am. I had no idea this was going to happen.
Oh my goodness, what was the terrible news?	My mom called me the day after my 28 birthday. Not to wish me happy birthday, but to delivery awful news.
I am so sorry, I hope your brother ended up being okay.	She called and told me our brother had been in a terrible accident and that we needed to come to the ER immediately.
Dang, that's not good. What did you end up doing??	I have not had any sleep for the past three days only to come back home and my neighbor is having a loud party
Oh wow. Did the police get called? I hope you didn't get in trouble.	I stormed into his house like a mad man,i was not having it.That had to stop.
Yeah? What is changing?	i'm eagerly anticipating the break from the routine of business
Brilliant. here are you going?	i'm going on a holiday soon!
Amazing! and Exotic	bora bora
That's so generous of you. The world could use more people like you.	As a nursing student I'm able to look forward to take care of people when they are feeling bad.
Caring for both the young and the old. Any hospital would be lucky to have you on staff!	Yes during on of my clinical rounds I was able to handle pediatric patients which I felt so happy to do.
Oh my, how did she react?	i forgot my friend's birthday date
Ha! Do you feel bad about it?	she was confused because i showed up a week late
It certainly can. What type of job are you looking for?	Looking for a new job can be stressful.
Maybe they had lots of other candidates to see	Well I went on 4 interviews to work in a clinic and all went well, but they have not called me back and its been a week now.
I know that feeling. Something will come through though	Yeah, but bills are coming up so its making me very worried and nervous.
Yes! I feel like the day escaped me. Have you done that recently?	Have you ever felt guilty for sleeping all day?
It is Friday, that would be a nice way to start the weekend!	Yes, I am thinking to do it again today though.
Ugh I can imagine. But your time will come, be patient!	i am so jealous because my sibling is going on a holiday and i have work to do
Have you tried yoga? It can help in the meanwhile till you get a proper vacation.	yeah but i really need a break
Oh no! Did you get the surgery?	Yeah I went into the hospital with chest pain and the doctors came in and told me I needed to have emergency surgery.
But you have recovered now. Right?	I did and what an experience. I was alone in the hospital getting prepped for a major surgery not knowing if I was going to make it.
Are you pregnant?	We both want a boy, but a girl at this point would be perfect as well
Congratulations! That's brilliant news	Yes after several attmpts me and my wife are finally expecting. This news is the best that I have heard!
Good job! Do you feel proud of yourself?	I got my final exam results the other day and I did really well.
Hard work always pays off! Keep it up.	yes very. Those longs nights I stayed up getting ready helped.
What did you do?	I walked into the room while she was cooking and was very quiet. I felt bad about what I did.
Man! That's pretty bad.	Well I went out with old college buds and got trashed and slept with another woman.
i hope it goes well for her	am so nervous my sister is going for surgey
good luck!	we hope so too
Awesome! Glad that you did well on the exam!	I didnt study for my test and I felt I bombed it, but when I checked my grade I made an A!
Now you can celebrate this exam result! Always feels good to accomplish something like this.	I agree. I was soooo not expecting that. im still boggled by it, but it made my day.
oh wow. that is some scary stuff!! what happend?	A man recently tried to break into our house late at night.
did they catch the person?	It was about 3am. He was kicking our front door repeatedly.  My kids and wife were terrified as we waited for the cops to come.
You shouldn't like to your mom. I think you should tell her the truth about what really happened.	i feel guilty for lying to mom that i had passed my exams
That sounds like a great idea!	yah, i will tell her when she comes back from work
Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail	I felt very unpleasant last week when i fell to the ground skateboarding and lots of people saw it happen
That's good! Practice makes perfect and if everyone stopped when they failed, we would not have as much as we do today	Yeah it was bad but i kept practicing and eventually learned pretty quick
That's terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?	Last week at work a coworker tried to take credit for a job that I had completed.
I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.	I talked to my boss and get it all straightened out, but it was still a really crazy situation.
what kind of surgery was it?	I recently had surgery and needed help around the house and my best friend volunteered to help me.
Thats awesome! Its great to have friends their for someone.	I had knee surgery so my normal household chores is hard to keep up but she kept her word and she has helped 2 a week since she is so true to her word I have a great friend.
Oh no! Did you scold him?	My dog chewed my favorite pair of shoes up last week.
I'd be angry too, but it's hard to get mad at doggos.	No she got me with those eyes but I was very irate with her for a few days and she knew it.
Congrats to you!  What kind of nurse are you looking to be?	I finished college this summer and now I'm on to a new job in nursing I am nervous.
I have no doubt that you will be a great RN!	I will be a RN I think I am over thinking the new role but I am self assured I will do great this is my passion.
That is awesome, what is his secret?	College is the top way to get in debt but my brother paid all his tuition out of pocket.
Being debt free can be a great feeling	He worked 2 jobs and prior to starting he saved money I'm very influenced by his method I'm going to give it a try so I can be debt free as well.
Im sorry to hear that. Does she have a job now?	Last year my wife got laid off from her job.
Well that was nice of your boss. Its great to have good people in this world	At the time it happened, my boss found out about it and gave me more hours to make up for our loss of income till she got another job.
Are you excited for it?	My girlfriend is moving in this weekend.  This is the first relationship I have had that actually will be living with me.
I hope this is the true love for you	I am very excited for it.  Im ready to start this next chapter in my life and hoping everything goes well after the move.
You got this just be yourself and professional obviously and don't over think it.	I have a job interview coming up later this week.  I feel confident about it but would love for it to be over
You will get it happy thoughts only and if not something better is in store.	Thats my plan going into it.  It would be awesome if I got the job but if not I am happy where I am at too
It sounds like you are a great parent.  Does she appreciate all the help you give?	I love to help my daughter with her school work and exams.
She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.	Thank you and yes she does the memories together just pleases me so much I cherish these moments.
Im sorry about that. How did you find out?	After being married for 8 years to my first wife, I found out she was having an affair behind my back.
That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?	She came out and told me about it. It was one of the worst times in my life.
Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?	My dog just learned how to ring the bell on the doorknob when he needs to go out
That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.	I put the bell on the door so it would ring when it opened and he got used to that, so now he associates the sound with having to go out.
I understand! As we get older, it's hard to do it all everyday!	I canceled a dinner with a old friend because I was just so tired had a long work week.
It happens, but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you	It is I just feel a little guilt-ridden because I told her I had an emergency instead of telling her the truth because she would have tried to talk me into still coming out.
Oh no, are you able to afford the repair for it?	Last month my car threw a rod and needed to have the engine overhauled, leaving me without a way to get to work and back.
What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.	Well, a friend of mine let me borrow his car for a entire month while mine was repaired. He just tossed me the keys and said bring it back when your done.
I hope you can too. How is it going?	I working to save enough money to take my wife on a vacation to Vermont next year. I hope I can save enough.
That's great! I have faith that you can do it.	I'm about half way there. I want to save enough to rent a cottage on one of the lakes up there so I still have a ways to go.
That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?	I paid off my credit card before buying my house.  I didnt realize how expensive owning would be and after some repairs I owe more than I started with on my card.
That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that, I'm cutting them up.	Im hoping I wont have to.  Unless something major comes up I'm not planning on putting anything on credit again.
That would have really scared me.	I was with some friends and went up to my room.  It was late at night and the lights were off.  When I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.
I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.	It did scare me.  I let out a scream.  One of my friends went to school for wildlife.  He captured the bat and let it outside which was great.
All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?	I brought home a cake for my family, but I ate all of it! Ugh.
Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.	Uhm, I feel awesome in my tummy, but bad in my heart LOL
ewww.	My roommate was very forgetful.  He would sometimes leave his dogs poop bags inside instead of bringing them out to the garage.
Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?	It was gross.  All of a sudden you would smell something and then notice the bag sitting there.
You are having trouble with family ?	I was watching TV and saw people with a happy family. It breaks my heart.
Mine isn't either. Are you married?	My family isn't close, it's depressing.
Awesome! What are you going to see?	I'm so hyped, I'm going to the movies!
Whatever it is, I hope you have a good time!	Not sure yet, I'll have to ask my friends
Oh no!  How'd you do that?	I broke my leg, it's so upsetting.
What were you doing on the roof?	I fell off a roof!
Did you catch anything?	We decided to go fishing last week.
Did you at least have fun?	No!  And I was so confident that we would!
congrats! you must be proud!	My daughter graduated high school!
My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go	I am, thanky ou!
That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?	I believed my father wouldn't let me down.
Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you.	No, he totally bailed on me, as usual.
Oh gosh, you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear	I'm about to move and I'm terrified! What if it has bugs? Or mold? Or something else I don't know about?
I would have a heart attack!	Yes! I can't imagine them crawling on me when I sleep :/
I have no idea what those are!	I remember eating my Baba's pierogies as a child, so yummy.
oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?	They are ukrainian pasta, kind of like stuffed pasta.
What are pierogies? a type of food?	I am so sad I have no pierogies.
Ah nice, I love dumplings, what are in them?	They are Ukrainian dumplings.
That's no good, did you throw it out?	The milk I drank this mornign went bad!
Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.	Yes, but not before I drank some. :/
Oh, I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!	I once had a fluffy cat named Leo, but he got lymphoma and I had to have him put to sleep.
Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!	I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs.
This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!	I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger, and I have one right now named Chunk.
Oh, I shouldn't be ungrateful, lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!	Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant, but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts.
Did you get a promotion?	I was so happy!  I have been working so hard for this company since I started so this is a great sign in my opinion!
Wow, great job!	Not yet but I did get a raise!  If the company takes over I will get to be in charge of the helpdesk though!
Oh no!  What has you scared?	I'm really scared to go back to school.
It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.	It's all new to me, I've never done it before
oh dang thats so horrible	My mother died, I'm a mess.
it gets better with time but it must be hard	Thank you :(
I remember that store! I loved going shopping there, was it your first job?	I really miss Hastings.  I spent so much time in that store when I first started college.  Both just hanging out and working.
Yeah, I bet, it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.	It wasn't my first but it was my most favorite retail job I had
Are you having any specific problem areas?	I pray I can do well in school
Okay. I hope you do well too.	Not yet, but I haven't started yhet
Interesting, those things are huge, Do they even make them any more?	I've really wanted a Ford Excursion for a long time.
Do you have a large family, or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?	They haven't made them for quite a few years.  But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!
5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.	We don't have a huge family, just 5.  But my wife does daycare, and our current vehicle only has 5 seats, so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.
It is a big change. What is scaring you?	I'm scared to go to the cottage
I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in	I don't like bugs!
Is it really far?	I am sad my cousin is moving away.
oh no. im sorry to hear that	Yes, another country
Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?	I had some friends over and went upstairs to my room.  All the lights were off and when I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.
Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!	Hahahaha, that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies I had seen!  I let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free.
You were ready? That's good to hear.	I was totally ready for my garage sale
Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif	Yes and we made $1026.25!
Are you prepared?	I have an interview coming up.  Its for a position that someone else already has but I need to do this interview to get my name out there and let the higher ups know I want to move into management.
I bet. Good luck to you	I am prepared for it.  I'll be a lot happier once it is over.
Where you supposed to be there? If so, then that is a nice feeling.	I went to work the other day, and I was the only person in the office.
Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also.	Yeah, everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while, but got a bit lonely.
That's great. What classes are you taking?	I am starting back at school next month. I am excited about getting back into my classes.
That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?	I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors.
You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.	I want to be a software developer I think, so I like the programming.
Any time. Have a good weekend :D	I really like school, so you never know what I might decide to go for next. Thank you for the advice.
Did that happen tonight?	My dog just died in my arms.
Well, it must've been something you said.	No, it was a few years ago.
Did she have a party?	My step-daughter just turned 16 in the past week.
Does she have her license yet?	We're actually having it this coming weekend.
Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??	No . . . that's a long story involving her idiot father.  I'm somewhat glad, though, as she can't seem to set her phone down.
Does she play any sports?	Text, video chat, watch some goofball put makeup on, and shop.  Things most teenagers do, I suppose.
That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.	I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside.
It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!	I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)
You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?	I was shocked by my present.
Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?	It was my anniversary.
I agree.. Did something happen?	Humanity is the worst.
I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.	No, just frustrated
That was nice	My mom spent a lot of money buying me a computer for my birthday
Do you have anything in mind?	Yes, I love my mom and I will give her something even better for her birthday!
So, I take you left to live someplace else?	My old roommate never did any dishes.  He also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time.  It was miserable living there.
Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!	Haha yes, I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.
Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?	I recently tried to get a manager's job in my company, two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job.
I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.	I had much more experience than both of them, but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.
That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.	My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but he made it through college
Well, hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.	I was.  I know how hard it was for him so it was great seeing that hard work pay off in the long run.
I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?	My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but made it through it.
That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?	He did!  He actually just started a new job that he loves and is related to his degree.
Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?	My girlfriend is moving in this weekend.  It will be great finally living together.
It's a huge step, congratulations!	We have been dating almost a year.  I'm just excited to take this next step in the relationship.
Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.	My girlfriends aunt just died.  She wasnt close to her but is still devastated because of the impact it had on her sister.  I'm doing whatever I can to help them both.
Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.	Thats very true.  I know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now.
Is he sick or just being lazy?	My friend and coworker hasnt been coming into work.  People are starting to talk but its hard to stick up for him when he only comes in once or twice a week.
I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.	A little bit of both.  He has bad anxiety but he also has told me he just doesnt like going into work.
Oh, well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!	One time during Kindergarten, I peed myself because the teacher did not let me go to the restroom
LOL, well, that's good to know. So am I!	Thanks! Luckily I am potty trained now!
Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?	One of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up.
That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes.	Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!
Thats... uh... strange?	The first time my girlfriend slept over I farted on her leg in the middle of the night.  She knew it happened but didnt say anything.  She also doesnt know that I know.
I think so, you're two peas in a pod.	It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!
Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.	I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!
A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done.	Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.
Oh my god! That's terrible!	One time when I was letting my cat outside, it ran out into the streets and got ran over
Oh that's so great!	Then I woke up, it was all a dream.
That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough	my son just won first place at his championship swim meet!
LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it	Thank you! He takes to it like a fish in water. HaHA!
Oh man! I hope no one noticed.	One time when using the public restroom, I had toilet paper hanging from my shoe when I went outside
I'm glad that it all worked out!	Unfortunately I kept getting looks! It's alright though!
Oh, I bet you are really torn.	I have a goal I want to get on here tonight but my dog really wants to play.  I feel bad that I'm not playing with him but would really like to hit my goal before I do.
I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.	I am, I would think I'll be done pretty soon and then take him for a nice long walk.
That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??	My girlfriend broke up with me recently
That is hard! Relationships are hard work.	We drifted apart it seems
That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?	A friend of mine drove me to work when my car broke down
That is nice of you, glad you have supportive friends!	I took him out to dinner later on, he's a good friend
Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/	I saw a mouse run across my kitchen floor
They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.	I hope I can catch it at some point
What happened to them?	A co-worker of mine was late with work materials
Good, sorry you were inconvenienced, hope things get more consistent!	I eventually got them, but it almost cost me this project I've been working on
that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.	I was watching my girlfriends son the other weekend and was trying to think of an activity we could do together.  I decided on cooking and got everything before he came over.
that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella	Yeah, he seemed to have a good time.  We made cheese too which was a first for both of us.  It turned out pretty good too which was nice.
Did you study for it at least?	I am nervous for my college test
That is true, well best of luck to you friend!	I did but it is a law school exam. You just never know.
That is bad. What did you do after that?	I was walking around my office and someone spilled coffee on me
Did he say sorry?	I went to the bathroom to clean up, it was a new shirt as well
What show was it?	When I came home, a TV show I had set to record was all ready to go
is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?	Black Mirror
Oh? What about them?	I keep remembering my old college days
That's true. Any memory in particular?	Just how fun and carefree they were.
Is it really? How hot is it there?	I'm spending my first summer in Massachusetts. It's a lot hotter than I expected it to be.
That is hot, but it is a bit hotter where I live here	The hottest it got was 99 degrees. It has been in the mid 80s mostly, but I was expecting cooler weather in New England.
Did you feel lonely, or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?	I was all alone when my family left for the weekend.
That is tough when you're not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?	A bit sad. More bored than anything.
Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned?	I'm looking forward to meeting with some friends on the weekend
Well that sounds like a fun little trip.	Probably go hiking and visit some local towns
thats nice to be able to relax	After a long day I finally got my dog settled down and I dont have any work.  It feels nice to just sit for a little bit.
everyday is a good day!	Have you had a good day?  Hopefully you dont have a busy weekend and can relax a little bit.
Really? You must really like you job then	I feel ready for the coming work week
Good for you! I hope you  have good week!	Yeah, I think I have all my work materials set
Awesome! I am happy for you!	I had an online interview today for a teaching position and I nailed it!
I am sure you will do fine! Good Luck!	Thanks! Regardless I am a bit nervous. There are a lot of things to remember and I don't want to look like a fool on the job.
Oh I am so sorry. Best thing to do is be there for her.	I found out recently that my girlfriend's cat has cancer and we cannot afford the operation to remove it.
I have and it really hard. It just takes time But a good support system makes it way better.	Thank you for your sympathies. Have you ever dealt with losing a pet?
how did she handle it	My girlfriend was having a bad day at work a few days ago.
well that was nice of you	Well, I sent her some pizza and it was so unexpected it turned her whole day around!
did it help?	I spent two hours studying material for an interview.
congrats! i hope it works out	Definitely. I aced it, and now I'm officially in a trial period!
That was good of you.  He didn't hurt her did he?	A while back, I intervened when I saw my dad was picking on my younger sister.
Oh no!!! Where did you end up going?	No, but he was just being mean. So mean he decided to kick me out of the house.
That was so awesome of your mom :)	To my girlfriend's place. Luckily it only lasted a week, and my Mom is super caring and loving. She took me back in against his wishes.
Why did they do that?	Walking home alone from school one day, three young adults jumped in front of me and yelled in my face.
That is terrible. Those days, a lot of people do stupid things.	For no good reason; there are evil people in this world. I was so scared I cried on the way back home.
Children usually do really well, they are versatile.	I wasn't sure how he would do since he didn't go to PreK.
I hope he continues to do well.	I have heard that, but now I truly believe that!
Are you excited or will it be lonely?	My daughter is officially all grown up she is leaving and going off to college next week.
Yeah that is scary. I am sure she will do great things though!	In between I am very positive that she will be ok but just the thought of your first born going into the real world away from you is scary a little but I know she will be just fine.
I bet it was really quiet and lonely. Did you find some time for yourself though?	My kids was away all summer I missed them like crazy when they was gone.
I don't think I would like that quiet either.	A little to quite and I was very lonely I'm glad it's over lol I started isolating my self to much when they was away.
Well that's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test?	I know I have high potential so the fact I failed my college course had me down.
Never be too confident! You've got to give life your all at every step.	The test and the whole semester I just didn't give it my all like I should have and now I feel really crappy and regretful I need to redo course and give it my all.
I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice	Some restaurants just have the worst workers they are so rude and mean to us the customers.
Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them	Exactly what is even worse is the managers who are just as rude, I get so upset I had this happen to me at Wendy's staff was so unprofessional.
How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn, etc..	I will officially be a first time home owner next month.
I can imagine!  It is certainly an exciting time.  I bet you are just over the moon happy!	I am this is all I ever wanted for my family and it is about to come I am so thrilled with joy can't wait.
Any experience with what?	Do you have any experience about it
Yes some things	Anything that made you happy
Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?	I packed a sandwich before I went to work
Well, it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.	Yup, and I am too lazy to drive out to a restaurant!
Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there.	One time I saw poop smeared all over the public restroom
Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?	Yup the smell was disgusting!
Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.	One time I looked at the mirror and thought I saw a monster
No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!	Yeah. Unfortunately, it was a monster! I am just ugly!
Aw that's nnice of her	My mom spent a lot of money to buy me a computer
Moms are the best	Yup! She worked hard for like 3 weeks to save up for it! I love her!
Did you kill the snake?	One time while I was camping, there was a giant rattle snake trying to attack us
That is too bad, will you ever camp again?	Nope! I packed up and went straight home!
Did they do a good job?	I had business meeting about a year ago where I had to rely a lot on my co-worker.
Did you take them out for drinks after the meeting?	Surprisingly they he did, I guess sometimes we I need to trust people.
sounds awesome	I had dumplings at a hotel yesterday, and for a hotel restaurant food they were actually good.
i would have loved to do the same	Yes, it was a tasty lunch.
Did you resolve things?	I got into an argument the other day with my 18 year old son.  I still feel badly about it
I hope you can get over that pain.	Yes eventually, but I am sorry to admit that I said things I should have never said to him out of anger.
That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.	One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and won $20!
That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!	Yup, I am going to buy another one just because of you! I hope I win!
That is really upsetting!	I was upset when my family kept leaving me on vacation
Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them	It was. I just wanted some quality family time.
for fun?	My cousin and I used to beat eachother with sticks.
well that sounds pretty fun!	Yeah. We called it the box game and walked around inside of a refrigerator box for protection.
Were you satisfied with the results?	I was very well prepared for my law exam.
Excellent!	I was! 95%
how did it go	I enthusiastically told my family about everything wrong with my life at that point.
oh well maybe next time	Not good. I was very drunk though
how many days has it been?	Quitting smoking was so much easier than I expected it to be!
wow thats great!	2 years
Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.	I was grossed out when I saw someone vomit outside a bar.
Some people can't hold their liquor.	For sure. it was not a pretty sight.
I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?	Life is a lot better when you can eat solid food. Never get your jaw wired shut it sucks.
Man that sounds aweful.	I got punched while drunk without a mouth guard years ago - still think about it !
Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can't touch you	Life is good right now for me too
Absolutely	Right just staying active, don't need much money, minimal drama. Easy
I feel like everyone goes through that phase.  I know I did too	I used to feel lonely a lot as a teenager. That was dumb of me
Would you say you're more of an introvert?	I've noticed that it's easier to be happy while not around someone all the time.
Especially in the south	August is way too hot.
Oh wow, that does sound horrible	Right. I live as north as you're gonna get in the US and it still sucks.
did you find out the results?	GED test was super easy. I was confident that I would pass it
dang thats awesome!	Yeah I crushed
Oh wow and you couldn't keep your job? What were you going to school for?	Two years ago I decided to go back to school after working at my job for 12 years. At the time I was very nervous about my decision.
Oh wonderful! One of the best fields to be in right now	I still work there, but just part time now. I am studying Computer Science.
Wow! Good luck, there are so many things you can do with that degree and from home too!	I love it. Just ten more classes to go until I finish.
That is awesome. I never even get a second date A husband may not be in the cards lol	My grandparents have been married for 50 years I hope to be like that one day.
Thats sweet. I bet they enjoyed it	lol you just haven't came across the right person yet. It is incredible I arranged and had them a surprise dinner party it turned out very nice.
I hate bad traffic, did you get in an accident?	Here in Florida the traffic and wrecks is bad and always happening.
That's the worst, I hate when people are careless.	Due to a reckless driver running the red light, but most wrecks I have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended I get so irritated I swear.
I know what you mean	I get so angry when people stand me up it's so rude.
that sucks. have you talked to her?	My coworker did this recent we was suppose to have lunch she didn't call or anything.
That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well, professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?	Professional settings is suppose to get along and be great but not my place of work staff fight like cats and dogs there.
I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building, communication, and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.	We have a team building coming up and let's hope this works which I predict it will be some type of good outcome.
Wow, you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?	I just drove 12 hours back from my parents' house. It wasn't so bad though, because I actually packed everything I needed for once. I was able to minimize the amount of stops I took and cut two hours off of the total time it took!
I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life	I work. We moved far from where they grew up when I was young, and they ended up moving back for retirement.
I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?	I was pretty bummed to find out that my favorite coworker is transferring to a different department.
At least they aren't gone completely, but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.	Once in a while, here and there.
i would be really annoyed myself, why so many frequent calls ?	I prequalified for a mortgage last week online. The bank I applied with has called me 3 times a day ever since. I'm getting pretty frustrated.
i know ever since i purchased a new car, i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day , its really annoying	I'm not sure. This is my first time shopping for a mortgage, so I'm not sure if it's normal or not.
I know right! my parents love tennis, so I grw up watching it.	I watched Wimbledon for the first time last summer. Those tennis players are SO GOOD!
were you ever any good at it?	I had played a little bit growing up, but never watched it professionally.
Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?	It was so life-like and I have such fond memories of playing in there.  My stepdad worked for pillsbury and brought home dough and I would pretend I was baking.
Are you still in contact with him?	Yes somewhat, although with all that practice in childhood I should be much better.   I miss my stepdad so much.   I have nothing but fond memories of him.
Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.	I looked at a house I really liked last week, but just found out it was taken off the market.
I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.	Yeah, it'll be okay though. There's always something else that will come available.
That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?	I had to drive 12 hours straight last week. For once it wasn't terrible, because I packed everything I needed. Took two hours fewer than it normally does!
I'm sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.	Vacation. Went to go visit my parents.
Was he alone?	I came home from work, expecting an empty apartment. My boyfriend was home from his trip a day early!
Cool. Did you do something special?	Yes, I was very excited to see him.
Congrats	I got a promotion at work! I'm so excited!
Do you get a raise?	Thank you!
Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account	My bank has called me three times a day for the past week, and I'm tired of it.
Are you interested in mortgage for now?	No, I prequalified for a mortgage, and they've been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since.
Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?	My roommate leaves her leftovers in the fridge for a disgusting amount of time.
If you share the fridge, I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.	No, I don't feel like it's my place to tell her what to do.
cool. did he have gifts?	I came home expecting an empty apartment, but my boyfriend had come home a day early from his trip!
Oh. I am lol	No, but I'm not big on gifts.
Like what? Bad or miserable?	Do you feel anything like that
Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces	sad, when you see beggar in the street
Wow. enjoy your own time.	Next month my wife and I are going on our first vacation, I can hardly wait.
Yeah, you're right. Hope you've memorable vacation.	I will, it is going to be great to get away together.
Wao,thats really not cool	My ex boyfriend and I started having trouble getting along and we were under a lot of stress over money.   After awhile of this he started putting a password on his cell phone so I couldnt get in to see his messages.  THat was the first sign!
He doesnt deserve you,so wipe your tears	NO, not cool at all.  We ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl.   I wasted four years of my life for that to happen.
That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too	I found myself suddenly by myself and it seemed as if all the people I had become friends with were no longer wanting to still be friends.  I mostly met all of them through him when we got together, and when he left me he told them not to speak to me anymore and they listened.
Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though	I dont think they do.  He was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me .  I dont think it was so much the lies he made up because they knew they were not true.  I think they were just loyal to him.
That's awesome, I wish I could build my own house.	I love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me
Well thank you as well.	Is the conversation over? You are welcome then.
Did she die recently?	Her name was Lily and she was a pit bull, my favorite breed.   I loved her so much.  We did everything together.  She would go wherever I did.
Oh wow! Thats so sad, I know animals can be like kids to use. I'm so sorry	No she had to go to the humane society when my ex boyfriend and I broke up.   I had no choice, and he did it just to hurt me.  Lily would go swimming with me, ride on our boat etc.  When she was just a pup she would sit on my lap as i rode the four wheeler.
That can ruin a persons life.	He was originally suspended at 17 when he again got got with a little bit of weed.  They have a law here in missouri called 21 and under law.  Automatically get suspended for a year if ur a minor in possession.
That is such a mess.	I know it can which is why I was so worried at court.  THe judge looked at him and said son you need to hire you a lawyer.  I  throw people in jail for things like this.
Tell me more, sounds exciting!	The best thing happened at work today!
Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work	Well we have these weekly meetings about our goals and today I was recognized by name in front of everyone for a job well done.
Oh no what happened?	Ugh! Tonight was such a bummer.
What concert was it?	I was going to go to a concert but couldn't get myself to go by myself at the last minute. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.
That probably would have been fun.	It was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians. I really liked the lineup!
That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now.	The aftermath was awful.  Trash and debris was everywhere and we were homeless.  We lived out in the country and it took some time before red cross came out to do their report and get help to us.
Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.	I am doing better now but it was really hard times.  We had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go.  Unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well.
That is so messed up!	I ordered a new phone last week, and when the box got here it was empty.
I would be so angry.	Yeah, I was pretty upset, especially when they initially refuse to refund my money.
Oh wow, What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry that must've been super hard	A few years back I had to bury my dog, who had died at the age of 13.
I can imagine. I haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and I'm dreading the day	He was a lab.  It broke my heart, to be honest.
That's wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?	I thought I would never get the chance or opportunity to better my life as well as my childrens.  I cant wait till I get that degree
That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference!	I am getting a counseling degree to help abused women.  I feel I would make a good counselor since I  have been in a few abusive relationships myself.
Yeah? Which game was it for?	I saw a video game trailer recently that really brought me back!
Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.	The new Spyro Remastered game coming out. Seeing it really reminded me of how I used to play the original all day with an old friend of mine.
Oh no. What did you do?	I had a flat on the way to work this morning, and the jack handle was missing from my car.
Lol, well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?	I used a screwdriver to work the jack. It sucked, lol.
That's great. What made it so special this year?	I just celebrated my birthday and it was so much better than usual.
Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.	I usually don't do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing. It was a great time.
I am so happy for you! Congrats!	My wife and I have tried to have a baby for over three years, and had given up hope.  Two weeks ago, we found out she was pregnant.
I wish you nothing but the best!	Thank you!  We were both pretty shocked by the news, lol.
It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.	I was in an extremely dangerous abusive relationship at the time and I knew he was intending to put her in the middle of it all.   He intended to use her for leverage over me .
Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.	Oh my I am getting ahead of myself.  I was referring to when I had to put my daughter emerson up for adoption in 2011.
Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?	Ugh! My friend is definitely getting on my nerves today.
Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too	We made plans to catch up but never set a time. I tried to contact him to figure out what time and he never got back to me. I was looking forward to catching up.
That sounds very bizarre.	Yes, I pray not to be found or trapped like they trapped me to stab unknown man.
I hope you are okay.	Serious, that has being my worse situation so far
That is so messed up!	My car window was broken when i walked up to my car this morning!
I hope this doesn't happen again.	Yeah it is! Im going to have to spend money I didnt have. Im so upset right now.
Oh my, what did you do, may I ask?	I really felt like a fool last night.
That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!	I was playing a board game with a few friends and I ended up spilling my entire drink all over the table.
Oh no, what happened?	Work was not a good experience today.
I hate public speaking too!	I had to explain how a bunch of things work in front of a lot of people. I'm not a fan of talking in front of a crowd.
Dallas is a really fast city.	When i moved to dallas I felt I would have the time of my life after living in a small town, but after a couple of weeks i got homesick.
I'm sorry, things will get better.	yeah it is. I dont know anybody and my classmates all have jobs. so I get to be at home by myself alot
What are your plans?	I'm really excited about this weekend!
Thats aweosme! Is he going to be staying with you?	A friend of mine has been out of the country for a year and he has finally come back. We're going to catch up.
That is terrible. What happened then?	So my sister drove my car to run an errand and got a ticket! She doesnt have her license
I understand. My mistaske always happened.	Well not much. Its just I feel bad because I told her I would take her but got so busy. Maybe im the one that should have got the ticket. not her
Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track.	Financial troubles are sometimes the worst! Ugh.
That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position.	You really have to. Luckily, my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet. It's definitely nice to have people who are willing to help.
You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?	so my brother will be the first out of 4 kids of my parents to have a baby and today is going to be the gender revealing party.
Well, it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy!	we all want a boy so we are all cant wait to find out what it is. everyone is so impatient about it, but today is the day.
Do you plan do something this weekend?	I'm looking forward to how chill this weekend will be.
Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.	Quite the opposite, really. I just paid all my bills and have not really any plans. Sometimes it's nice to just not have that stress and relax.
That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?	So this year will be the first time I been to a haunted house. Im get scared easilty so Im kinda worried. I promised my friend I would go with her.
Well, if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine.	I dont know, but I feel I should not go, but again I promised my friend I would go. I dont know wha to do now.
Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.	Me and this girl have been dating for awhile now,so I think Im going to ask her to be my girlfriend.
I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.	Yes I agree. I feel that way about it. You know me too well.
That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more.	My sister's cat got sick and had to be put down last week. Feels bad.
I agree, just remember her for all the good memories.	She had stomach cancer, so she was in a lot of pain. Definitely the right thing to do
Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?	I have a huge exam coming up tomorrow.
What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety.	It's for a PC Architecture class. I'm feeling really good about it though since I studied really hard all week!
That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?	There are maggots all over my building's garbage bin this morning. I got one on my arm when I walked by
I understand. The best thing is to move.	They don't care. They live upstairs and are very dirty people. I'm moving as soon as I get a job!
That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining	Coming home driving in the rain my car hydroplaned on the freeway!
You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be	I agree and thank god I was the only car on the freeway , otherwise It would be a different story!
Really, where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday	I'm amazed on how many people came to the parade considering the rain!
I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!	I'm here down south and It has been pouring as well, but that didnt stop people from coming! Im shocked.
oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat	I just saw a commercial about the Rescue Animals. Everytime I see it it makes me so sad.
whats preventing you?	Yea. It reminds me of my old dog that was a rescue. So many memories. I want to go get one actually.
you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!	I started nursing school and work full time, so I wont give much time to it. I want it to be a happy dog.
That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?	I love mystery boxes in games! Unfortunately I usually don't get anything good.
It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!	Almost any game that has an online component! Like right now I play The Secret World and it has mystery boxes.
How exciting! She must be thrilled too	So I will be going to see my mom after 2 years of not seeing her since starting school! I cant wait
I hope you guys have the best time!	Yes she is. We are all so excited to finally hang out! We have so much planned
That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?	So the role I worked so hard for went to a person who could care less about the play!
I hate it when stuff like that happens.	I guess you can say that! What a day!
Haha, nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.	I agree. Maybe I will act like him next time.
Sounds like the best course to me :)	Yeah your right. I will stick to my little envious rant and go about my day
That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good.	Once, I went camping with my family. We saw many animals and a beautiful creek. It was a happy time.
You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile.	It does! I really hope we get to go camping again this fall.
That sucks, sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?	We order Chinese food last. The order was completely wrong but the lady seemed very helpful when we called.
Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!	We didn't get a refund but they were able to fix the order. I was really craving Chinese!
Did it taste good?	I ate a lot of my kid's Halloween candy. I told her the candy was old and I had to throw it away.
Did it taste good?	It was really good! She had a lot of candy. I was hoping she wouldn't notice some missing!
Were you suprised that they did this for you?	two weeks back i celebrated my birthday and do you know what my office colleagues planed for me
Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement.	yes and i am quiet happy that they also brought my wife who stays in london for party to surprise me
You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work	yes it took me with a surprise how well my colleagues planned for me
oh so sad , what happened to it	So my childhood dog died last week. My mother called me with the news.
it must must a very much hard time for you and your family	He died of old age. He could barely walk so they put him down. Yeah pretty bad news. It made my day blue
yes , he be rest in peace	Yes it is. He is in a better place now.
I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?	We went camping in the mountain. We did not know it was bear season. There were a lot of hunters and hunting dogs in the area. They were chasing the bears into one area
Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.	Luckily, the hunters kept them around a mile from camp. It was still very hard to sleep! We heard dogs barking at the bears all night!
Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.	We were in a tent and all of food was in a Yeti! I made sure everyone put their food away and burned leftovers in the fire.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family.	We had a doberman for over 8 years. He passed away last spring. It was a hard time for our family.
You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family.	They are like having another child! I hope to have another doberman one day. They're really good dogs.
That's disgusting. What did you do about it?	last week i visited a restaurant and found a insect in the burger which i ordered
Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!	i immediately raised an alarm about the issue and complained to store manager
That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.	We have homeschooled our daughter for the past 3 years. This year, she has decided to return to public school.
Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.	She did miss having a lot of friends. I hope she does well. She starts in 10 days!
Wow good job! SO close	This will be my last semester in college! I cant wait to finish.
Thats a great accomplishment	THanks!. I get so happy everytime I think about it!
maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group	Since I moved to dallas I have not met any friends. I go to work and school and just come home.
i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump	I agree. It gets boring at home alone with no one.
that should be fun. good luck!	I agree. This weekend it is!
Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?	My sister lives in Utah. We had planned for her to come visit but her work would not allow her to take the time off.
I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end	I haven't yet. I would like to eventually. I'm hoping to see her soon
Did he take care of it for you?	So I was out of town this weekend and lent my brother my car. I was hesitant at first, but I felt he would do good with it and take care of it.
That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud.	He did. I feel I can let him use it more often after this.
That's awesome, what does your hubster do?	My husband works very hard so that I can be a stay at home mom. It has allowed me the freedom to homeschool our daughter.
Wow, I admire his dedication! And you won't ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!	He owns an auto repair shop. He works from sun up to sun down!
Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature, it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated	So my 1 year review at work is coming up and I feel its going to be good since I wokred so hard.
Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them	I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for.
Oh no, do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?	My child sneaked in my room to get the Xbox controller while I was sleeping. The night before, I had grounded her.
I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.	I think she thought she could play a few minutes of Minecraft and then return the controller before I woke up! I caught her getting into the drawer where I hid it.
Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?	My friend came to my house drunk and threw up everywhere.
Man, you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!	Yes it was! I could not do nothing. She was in a raging fit. Ijust made she she went to sleep ok.
So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity	My friends mother got diagnosed with cancer last month and its been hard on her.
Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for	Yeah. Shes my best friend, so I'm planning to go with her this weekend to see her mom. my heart breaks for her..
oh no!! Did anyone notice? it's normal though, we all do that sometimes	Last week I did a presentation at work and as I stood up I blew some gas!
oh man... It happened to me before, i know how embarrassing it is.	Yes it was loud. I can feel my face turn red and the room getting quiet!
That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?	So my little brother barely passed his finals to become a cop! I could not beleive it.
Well at least he passed - that's great!	Im very happy, but all he do through school was party and never study. Im shocked.
That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.	We went to the library where they had an animal expert stop by for the kids. My daughter was able to answer most of his questions that other kids could not. It made me smile.
I will do that, i had no idea.	You should check your local library. The ones in my area have tons of things, like a Lego club, for the local kids.
I'm really sorry to hear that.	My dad died of cancer in 2012. That was really hard for me emotionally.
I can't even imagine to be honest.	Thank you. I was prepared, but it was still difficult.
I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.	I hope you don't have to go through it for a long time.
I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.	It's always tough, even if someone is older.
that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?	I have a performance review and potential promotion coming up in the next few weeks.
You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig	I work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company. There is a chance that I could be made a manager!
you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance	I just hired a new hotel inspector, he has very little experience but wants to learn. Scares me.
i hope it won't happen!	Yes, I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired.
Oh no! Did he say anything about it?	In high school, I fell down the stairs in front of my crush. My face turned red and I ran away!
I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly, don't you!	He laughed at me. Looking back, I'm sure it was funny but in the moment, I could have died!
Awesome! What are you planning on buying?	Last night I won a gift card at Trivia night at the pub. Going shopping today.
Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!	I've got a baby due in December so something for the baby or my wife. I never bother getting my self anything.
Oh no that is crazy!	I found out my wife was dating someone else a year before we got married, we were together for 7 years at that point. Today I'm stressed!
Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out.	Yea, We have a baby due in December so I'm trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly.
I hate those things, i try to not eat those at all.	I woke up one morning to make a sandwich. The smell of the sandwich meat made me sick! I felt something was wrong and drove to the nearest store. I purchased a pregnancy test.
I eat steak and shrimp.	I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!
i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.	I have a friend that will not stop talking about himself. He always wants to talk about his latest investments, the books he has read, and how much he knows about the places that he visits!
i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?	I do too. It makes me not want to be around those types of people.
agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.	Exactly! I should really stop hanging out with him.
I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!	I am a big Taylor Swift friend!
How exciting for you! Have fun!	Yes I need to arrive at her concert tonight at  8!
You have a test coming up?	I know I studied well, but I can't stop worrying about it.
Well I hope you do well! Good luck.	Yes on Friday. It is the final.
That's interesting. What was she doing?	She had a lot  of friends that came.
That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business.	She had her birthday at Chuck E Cheese.
Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.	I love to coupon but sometimes I feel like the cashiers aren't trained properly. They will look at the coupon for every detail and do not understand the language in the fine print.
I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it	I agree. It's not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!
Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.	The cop said he was too old!
That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.	Too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving!
Oh no, he shouldn't have gambled.	I played a game of poker with a friend who had no idea what he was doing. I won about $100 from him that night.
I would've too, but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.	You are probably right! I felt bad when I was spending the money. I hope he didn't really need it.
Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?	Recently there have been a few break ins.
For real! Are you taking any precautions?	No, my neighbor did but that's close enough for me!
Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?	One time I saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food
Okay, that makes more sense then to me.	It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant
Where are you located ?	We made sure to board up for the hurricane coming.
I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.	We are in Miami, Florida 1 mile from the beach. .
Who did what?	The cop said I will probably never find out who did it.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!	I wont find out who the person was that hit my car while I was sleeping.
Oh no! Why not?!	My sons teacher isn't very nice to the young kindergartners.
I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!	Not, sure, but she is not very nice at all.
Never know who was?	I may never know who she was.
Wow that is aweful!	The women that hit my car and left before the police came.
Oh wow, what happened?	Near my house, there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted. When I was a teenager, a group of friends and I decided to go check it out.
That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?	When we pulled up, it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!
I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!	There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!
Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.	My hair has always been long and I had been scared to have a short hair cut. Last December, I finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair.
Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!	That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out!
That's awesome, I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month, it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?	I recently drove back to my hometown and went to the towns fair, it felt so nice reliving my childhood.
Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair, was always fun.	It was great, it didn't change much but it still has that 'soul' to it. Just felt great looking at it honestly.
You must have been sad and angry.	When I was in high school, I dated a guy for almost a year. A few weeks before summer, he broke up with me and started seeing another girl.
Yes first heart brake is so hard, I feel for you, something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.	I was. I would get really mad when I saw them at lunch or after school together. I was my first experience with heart break.
That's awesome! Congratulations!	This was my first time winning a contest on the raido!
No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun	Thanks! I will get to go free to the Taylor Swift concert tonight!
Ouch, hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.	I bought extra items during school lunch in high school. I have a negative balance on my account.
I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha, its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.	I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.
Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.	I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.
I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate!	Yeah we tried but he cut all communication, he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness.
Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.	So i recently traveled to Cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until 3 AM, and as we were walking back there were these 3 guys hiding in the shadows. We got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn't follow.
Well, at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.	Yeah it was quite an experience, my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people. But they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!
Oh no! That's sad, did he get them all?	I raised 6 chickens since they were babies. I was trying to let them free range but I forgot to put them back in their coop for the night. A predator was able to get to them.
Aw, that's too bad, hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!	Yes, it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.
wow, so what are you going to do with it?	I was looking through old clothes that i was giving away and found $40 in one of the back pockets. Made me very happy lol
nice, i hope that works out for you... good luck	Oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have, trying to get to $220 to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october. Hope i get a pair!
That is gross, I can't even imagine what that would taste like!	I was watching youtube and saw this guy eat a jellyfish straight out of the ocean. Looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat.
That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.	He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.
Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt.	One of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it, it was like 10+ feet of distance, really amazing stuff.
Did yall happen to get it on video?	Yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares. It was quite the experience.
Congrats!, I'm sure you must be very happy!	My older brother is getting married Friday.
Haha brotherly love, I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!	I am very happy for him! I thought it was never going to happen!
thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day	Having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person's life. I cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born.
i bet so!	It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.
Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?	im nervous for the new week to begin
That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away!	very busy and lots of traveling
We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!	I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha
Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.	Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!
Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?	I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight.
Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.	I was tired and wanted to get in bed early,
Great, when will you know your scores?	Had my finals last week, studied really hard for them. Felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm
Wow, that's fantastic.	Thankfully i knew them right at the spot, i got a 98!
Who doesn't?	He doesn;t seem to see the issue.
What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!	My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem.
That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?	I studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a 68 on it.
Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.	Yeah, passed with a 75, not what i wanted but at least i passed
Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).	i dropped my groceries in the parking lot
Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!	i grabbed the cans that rolled away, lol
That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.	One of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates 100$ each
Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?	Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy, worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.
That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.	"A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had ""call ahead seating"" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later, our table was not ready!"
Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.	That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.
Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.	We had a new puppy. He loved to chew on everything. I went to the grocery store and when I got back home, the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch. He had chewed through the bottom!!
Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.	They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.
That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.	I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally.
It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.	Same here, they're so incredibly important in this day and age.
Do they run them all day long - or at night?	i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door
Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.	during the morning and day on the weekends!
I don't blame  you because I hate camping.	My best friends invited me to a camping trip but I was a little anxious about the whole thing.
Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.	Really? I was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick. I ended up enjoying the trip in the end!
What happened?	i was blown away by how great my friends were this weekend
You are lucky to have such great friends!	they were very supportive and kind , helping me with some moving things
oh that sucks, i hope it has healed since then	A few weeks ago I was drinking with some friends at a park and I sliced my hand open while trying to rip a beer can in two.
ouch, that sounds awful	It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.
How come? Have you had awful weather lately?	i was shocked how nice the weather was this morning
Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!	not really but it was just especially nice this morning
Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!	I decided to move to be with my boyfriend.
Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all	I did, but I had to leave all my family behind
Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?	im mad at my neighbor today
How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.	he was using powertools loud in the morning
thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them	Last Christmas, I saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts.
me too!	Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.
I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.	The teacher I had for Calculus 2 last semester was so terrible at his job, I had to learn it all on my own.
Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.	Same here. Surprisingly, I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!
That's always a great start to a day.	i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm
How are you celebrating it?	absolutely, i was overjoyed
Oh wow. What's the exam on?	I have a big exam coming up tomorrow.
That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.	It's on PC Architecture. I'm feeling pretty good about it though. I studied really hard all week.
Oh no, what happened?	On my way back from a funeral, my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.
Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.	I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere, he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.
Congratulations! Retail really does suck.	I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.
Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.	Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.
Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?	Do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?
I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.	I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.
That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?	A while back, my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.
I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.	No idea. All I know is that I was furious, especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.
I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?	Last night was quite a bummer.
That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.	I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.
That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?	After working for a week straight and running a lot of errands, today is my first day off in a while.
Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.	It is, I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch, it couldn't get any better than this!
That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.	My older brother always makes promises he can't keep.
I hope he doesn't let you down.	I don't know why. Recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together, but he keeps postponing it. I'll ask him for a definitive day.
Something good happen to him recently?	I'm so happy for my brother!
That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.	He just graduated from college. He put in so much work.
Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!	My little brother failed his French class and had to spend three weeks in summer school.
Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.	French is a really hard language, I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.
That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?	My boyfriend's brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle.
I bet. I would've hid under the table.	Some things got broke and there were some bruises, but it was really scary to watch that.
That's nice. Why do you say that?	i am blessed to have a great family
That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.	they're just the best and always very helpful
That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?	Whenever my sister in law plans things, she only does it around her schedule.
Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.	Yeah, but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However, we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.
Oh yeah? Why is that?	This weekend was kind of a drag.
Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?	I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.
Are the good memories at least?	The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately.
At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!	Oh yeah, but it really makes me miss those times.
Which one?	I'm looking forward to this new game.
I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?	The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine.
That's rough. Why can't you help her?	I told my sister in law that I would help her with her books. After this last one, I felt bad because I told her I couldn't anymore.
Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.	I just have too much going on now with two kids, and working from home.
How long did it take them?	I saw some person eat like 30 hamburgers in Mcdonalds
He must of been sick after.	I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast, so like 10 minutes
That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time	One time I bought emergency supplies before a hurricane
Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal	Yup, people started charging like $5 per bottle of water
What was the news?	I just got some frustrating news the other day.
Are you going to ground him?	My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.
Why don't you join them?	My sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere.
Why don't you get another job?	We definitely don't have money for that, plus there are four of us.
That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?	Ugh. I got some awful news the other day.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.	I got news that my grandfather passed away. He was old but no one saw it coming.
Holy cow.  Was anything missing?	Hi there was a time that I was scared out of my mind I came home and my front door was unlocked and the lights were on in the house
Had they gone through anything?	no and that was the weird thing nothing was taken
oh yeah that must have been a good time	We recently celebrated my son's birthday, and had a big party.
Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it	It was! He got a lot of cool toys, and ate a bunch of ice cream.
that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation, where do you have planned to go?	Next month my wife and I will take our first vacation since we got married.
That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck	We are going to Hawaii for a whole week. We have saved a long time to be able to afford this, I can barely wait till next month.
I miss her. You haven't seen your mom in a long time?	Do you feel when you see your mom after a long time
I'm sorry, but I can't understand what you're saying.	Why! what is the reason
Oh man! I have been there, I hope you didn't have anything special down there??	Last year, during the spring, extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded.
Oh lord, i am so sorry! I have been there, that is hard!	I lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things I had saved, my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items.
taht sounds like fun, i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah. did you enjoy the party?	Last week, my coworkers all got together and threw me at party for my 20th anniversary at work.
ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre	Yes, it was great. I had no idea it was even happening, they are so sneaky.
Aww, I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?	I took my dog to the vet yesterday... it turns out that he's really sick.
I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.	It's not looking too good. I really hope he pulls through.
wow nice	I was working on a project in this past week, couldn't find it locally, so ended up ordering it online.
ooops sorry to hear that	Not really, it still hasn't shown up!  I'm pretty annoyed!
oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?	I saw a deer get hit by a car yesterday.
yea you never like to see stuff like that.	It wasn't dead, It was injured and moved to the brush on the side of the road. it was upsetting.
did you try to find its owner?	I opened up my mailbox this morning and there was a 10 dollar bill just sitting there inside!
well that was nice of someone	I asked my neighbors about it, no one knew anything about it. I guess it was left there intentionally.
That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?	A co-worker I've been working on a project with has been late
I hope it all works out in the end.	I plan on doing that, it's pretty disruptive
Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?	I just finished a major project at work for a client
I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!	Not at the moment, but I'm praying my supervisor and client likes it
What is the appointment for?	I have an appointment for tomorrow. I'm hoping the same thing.
Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.	My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week, I think there might be something really wrong.
You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.	Thank you. I hope it's something that he will get over soon.
I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.	5
Oh man, sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first, but getting to bed early will help with her future.	My child needs to start going to bed early to prep for school. Last night, I caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at 12am.
Well yea, they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.	I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.
that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket	A group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won $100,000 on the pick 6 last week.
i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha	They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them, and I said no. I regret that now, I could have really used a share of that money.
What kind of test is it	I studied really had so I am sure I will pass my test!
Oh I hope you do well then	It was my science final for college.
wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long	My friend went on a 14 day cruise to Europe. I wish that could have been me!
yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say	Right? Talk about ultimate relaxation!
that is really nice of him, how much time will you have to wait?	My son is supposed to be sending me some money...
well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction	Hopefully not too much longer. I've been waiting for a few days now.
that is horrible, natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them	I am scared of another hurricane coming through Florida. I had a bad experience last year.
not really, the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm	No, all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters?
I bet that was a wonderful day	When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life.
I am very happy for you	It really was, my life finally felt complete.
that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?	I got passed over for a promotion at work last week, even thought I had more experience than the other applicants.
well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry	I did, and it looks like I may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction.
It's a whole new world when that happens, I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?	I remember when I started my first office job out of college. I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect.
It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.	I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, but I soon got used to it.
Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?	I found some mold growing out in the garage
May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.	I ended up cleaning it myself, I think I got most of it out
what is that?	I was thinking about when we finally got to go pick up Rodimus after all that waiting!  I've never been so excited in my life.
oh that explains it!	It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha
Wow when the child just asked?!	I saw a child ask for a candy bar that the grocery store yesterday. The mother spanked the child in front over every one in the line!
I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.	Yes! It was awful! Luckily the man behind her spoke up. I could tell she was embarrassed but I was furious at her!
OMG that's so gross!	One time I saw someone's dog pooping in my lawn and they didn't pick it up!
That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all.	Yes, I wanted to throw it back at them!
Oh god. That's kinda gross.	I used the bathroom at Walmart the other day. I walked around the store for about 30 minutes before I realized I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe!!!
Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.	I felt gross hahaha I kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack. I hope know one saw.
Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?	My son just started a new school.  The communication with them has been terrible!
That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!	I sometimes find out but it seems so disorganized!
Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada, who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?	We went to the lagoon a few weeks ago. My friends dared me to jump off of the highest cliff into the water.
You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast!	That was what I was worried about! I ended up not jumping off of the highest one. I was too scared. I did jump off of the smallest one. That was really fun!
Do you feel ready for it?	I have a test coming up in one of my classes this week.
Awesome, hope it goes as planned!	Oh yeah, I'm definitely ready. I know I'm going to pass.
Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?	I had about 6 or 7 hummingbirds in my yard the other day feeding.
Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!	No. my camera isn't good enough to get good pictures, they are so small.
The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.	I was trying to buy a piece of property that came up on the market, but someone put in a bid before I got a chance and it has already sold.
That would have been awesome if you got it.	It is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and I pretty much grew up on, I would have really liked to have owned it.
That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.	I worked for weeks on a presentation for work. I practiced over and over. I felt relaxed the morning of.
Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.	You are right! I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!
What did they do to you?	I was under the impression that my friends would pay me back.
It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.	They owed me money but never paid me back. I suppose it's not a huge deal though.
I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once!	I worked with daughter for months with learning her multiplication tables. We've practiced and practiced and she still doesn't know them all!
That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha	We homeschool too! I hope she can get them soon! It will make this year's math so much easier!
Do you hike very often?	I'm going on a hiking trip soon
I've never been hiking, really! I'd like to go some day.	Here and there when I have time
Oh, such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!	I scrapbook pictures of my son and I am a few years behind!
Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.	My son just started school all day, so I plan to start scrapbooking.  I don't use Stamp It Up though.
So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.	This past weekend, my cat Sam passed away, he was 17 years old.
May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.	Yeah,it's been really strange the past few days without him asleep on my feet while I work.
That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.	I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.
Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!	No point in being a pessimist.
Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?	I baked a cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out to be so delicious! He was so excited.
Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!	Black forest cake! It happens to be both our favorite kind of cake. I made it from scratch. What's your favorite cake?
Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.	I felt so bad when I had to board my dog while I was on vacation. It made me feel like a bad dog mom!
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.	I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better.
What are some of your best traits?	I'm happy with the person that I grew up to be.
Do you exercise often?	I'm healthy!
Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha, and even if you did, dogs are worth it.	So we finally found the perfect Rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week!
Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way, I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.	No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy
I've never been, but it looks like so much fun.	I love going to Disney World. It makes me remember all the wonderful memories I made there as a child.
It would be so much fun to go there as a family.	It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet, but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday.
Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2	Sometimes when I am out in public, my son throws a tantrum.
They are too smart for their own good	Mine is 5.  Every now and then, he says a curse word, uses it properly too!
what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread	I was just about to make a sandwich to eat, when I discovered something really gross.
ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it	No, there weren't any bugs. But there was mold.
or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks	The head of marketing at my job recently dumped a bunch of new tasks on me and my coworker. I feel like she's just lazy and making us do her job.
did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel	Ha, that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.
Did you call the police?	I can't believe this!  Some kid at the gas station nearly hit me and then had the nerve to call me awful names!
Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty	No!  I got so flustered and kind of paniked.
That's great! I'm so happy for you!	Guess what!  I nailed my review for this year and got a raise!
Ooh, will you be managing anyone?	Thank you! I worked so hard and I am so freaking excited!  I am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!
I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?	I freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning
Ugh! Were you away from home?	Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!
Oh wow, she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you, but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.	My stepdaughter graduated from college in May and got a job in San Francisco making 3 times more than I have ever made.
Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!	I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.
That is a good feeling!	Whew. I finally got all of my work done for the day.
Nice! No kids at home?	It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.
Are you afraid of the dentist?	I am so nervous.  I have to go to the dentist tomorrow to get a filling replaced.
I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine.	I am!  I had a bad experience with one when I was younger.
Oh nice! That's super brave of you.	I spoke at a conference recently. I was a little scared going into it but felt great as I knew I knew my speech.
That's a great skill to have!	I'm actually one of those fortunate people who doesn't have a fear of public speaking.
That must have been a nice feeling.	I was cleaning out my attic and found a box full of old photo albums. I spent the next few hours looking at old photos and having a great time.
I love that nostalgic feeling.	It really was. I miss a lot of the people in the photos, made me really smile to see their faces again.
Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?	I am so irritated.  My dog keeps trying to eat up my shoes no matter where I put them!
Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.	Yeah she's only about six months.  Despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves...
Why he is working late?	My husband works late at night and sometimes I'm stuck by myself.
I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?	He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong, he is forced to stay to fix the issue.
Aww man that sucks for you	My aunt just signed for my cousin to get an FJ Cruiser! That is my dream car! He doesn't even have a job.
Hopefully! It is your dream car after all	It does! Maybe he will at least let me drive it!
That should be fun. Any big planes?	I'm looking forward to visiting a friend over the weekend
That will be nice to catch up.	Nothing too big, probably just wander around town
That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!	I'm so irritated at my neighbor. She moved out recently and left ALL her garbage and old furniture in our parking lot by the garbage.
I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off.	Not at all, that's what is so weird! She was really polite, quiet, and neat.
Oh no! That is terrible!	Last week the plant I work at was hit with massive layoffs.
I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!	I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job, I am happy but very sad for the others.
How do you feel these days?	Two years ago my wife and I got divorced. It has been very odd in this big house all by myself.
It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?	It has gotten a little better with time, but still a pretty sore spot for me.
Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?	I lost my job earlier this year. I was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job.
Wow! That's like a paid vacation!	Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!
Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret?	Last week a friend of mine won $2000 on a scratch off ticket. I buy those things all the time and never win squat.
Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!	Right place, right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.
That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!	My niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that's going around
I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time.	I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.
Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?	"My phone went missing. Imagine my surprise when I got a Facebook message ""from myself,"" it was the person who found it saying ""I have your phone."""
You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.	I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.
Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?	I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated, just out of curiosity.
Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.	Nah, although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.
Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?	My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before.
I have a 10 year old like that.	She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.
that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding	My daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer. We just found out that she made the team!
that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.	It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!
you are very welcome. good luck!	thank you!
That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!	My grandma threw away my high school yearbooks.
Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look.	I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?
I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February, so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?	We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.
I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.	It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter
I am sure she will be smart with it	I bought my daughter her first cell phone. It's a lot of responsibility for her. I hope she is ready for it.
You can always show her the ways	I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone
Were they okay?	I accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day.
At least you're not getting sued	Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.
Im good at that lol	Oh man, that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!
Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.	I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear.
I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.	This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared
I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?	We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out!
I am not sure I would do well in that house	Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up, it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.
Bet that brought back good memories.	After my mom passed away I found all our old cassette tapes in her storage, listening to those was pretty cool.
Where did you guys usually go?	Definitely, brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.
whats the competition on ?	I've spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend. I'm exhausted.
Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further	Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.
I wonder how that was noted on your report.	I'm so angry at my self. I was in my performance review today and I passed wind in front of my boss. OMG
Sounds like a wacky place to work.	I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement.
That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.	I got a raise today. I've pushed my self hard this last year and I deserve it.
Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.	Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!
Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?	For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.
I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!	I don't think so, it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.
Its so hard to monitor that stuff now	I told my daughter she wasn't allowed to watch Youtube because it's hard to monitor. I caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!
Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too	It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.
On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?	I walk my dog for 30 minutes at a time but no matter what, he always ends up using the bathroom inside! I wish he would left me know if he needs to go out.
Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.	No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!
No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.	My neighbor stole a package from me.
Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.	So check this out, I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it, the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!
you havent met all three people in the city yet?	I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone.
ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head	haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city.
What kind of job was it	My coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week.
Sales do sound hard to do	Sales, so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.
Is he going to be okay	My cat got sick the other day, he was really pathetic. I felt so bad for him.
I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain	Yes, thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.
That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.	My friend is a single mom who works full time. She just graduated college!
Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.	Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha
Why? Were they not working?	I think I got my coworker in trouble.
He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.	He called in sick, but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick, I thought he was just out. So, I accidentally told my boss where he was.
Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?	Thanks, that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!
That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?	Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in.
Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!	Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.
yea funny how that happens	Drove past the area my Middle school was in today. It was gone. I hated it when I was in school but now that's it gone I'm sad
well at least its being put to good use	It was not even that long ago I went to that school. It's been less then 10 years. They did not even build anything. It's a park now.
Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?	I'm going to job interview Thursday. I'm currently employed but I'm ready to move on.
Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?	Yes, I'm currently in middle management this would be the next step up. I'm excited and nervous
Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?	My cousin passed the CPA exam!
Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.	She's already working at a Big 4 firm so she's just going to stick with that for a few years. I'm proud of her, it wasn't easy!
That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!	I just got a new manager at work. She is really young but seems to be full of good ideals.
lol why do you have to steer clear?	I plan to steer clear. I'm going to relocate in January so I just need to lay low. I hope she does a great job.
ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!	I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home.
That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?	The other weekend I really wanted to go out, but I realized I don't have any good friends left.
Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.	Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.
It can be hard these days, money is tight	The other day I was short on cash I needed to pay my phone bill.
I bet that was a nice surprise	So true. I lucked out though and found a $20 bill on the ground! I hope the person who lost it didn't need it really bad because it definitely helped me out.
Did you get it all straightened out?	I lost my credit card this weekend and then in the worst place Walmart.
Wow that is awesome, too rare in these times, count your lucky stars!	Yes I was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it I was very grateful.
Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?	My oldest daughter started elementary school today I was so glad she had a great first day.
Oh boy, I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!	A new school that's why I was kind of nervous and scared but she loved it.
That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?	My neighbor keeps letting her dog use the bathroom on her balcony.
I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!	It's revolting. I reported her to the HOA but she keeps doing it. I'm going to say something if I catch her out there letting her dog out.
Bet that was a nice calming down.	The other day I made fish tacos and did nothing else all day but relax on the couch.
Did you get up to anything else fun?	Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure, just how I like it.
That sounds awesome, i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.	I did a walk a thon last week for back to school drive and needy kids it was s long walk but I finished it I felt so happy.
Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!	I did before the walk I was un-assured I would finish but I did so I was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money.
Oh gross, I would lose my appetite	Went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day. Saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt.
Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether	It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.
Oh my goodness, that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?	I am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago.
They can still bite, so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.	When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones.
Do you have OCD?	I'm a neat freak and my house has to stay clean and in place always such a pet peeve of mines.
I just love when the house is clean, makes you feel good.	Very bad and when my family has the house out of place I become so furious I just like things clean and in order.
That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?	My supervisor totally stole all the credit for a client I brought in.
I hope he got in trouble!	I totally did. And let the CEO know about his behavior.
Oh most are dreading going back to school. What's your major?	I start back college next week I can't wait to finish getting my degree for me and my family.
Nursing can be difficult, but if you have determination and a good support system, I'm sure you'll do great!	I'm going for nursing and I have dreaded going back for 6 years now but my support system pushed me to follow my dream I'm thankful to have them.
How'd it go?	I recently applied for a promotion at work.
I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.	I didn't get it.
That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?	I'm shopping for a new bicycle! Can't wait to pick one out.
Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike	I have been recently, yes. I'm using an old beat up hand-me-down mountain bike so getting the right bike for me is going to be so much fun.
That's horrible. What can people do to change things?	The crime rate in my city is so high right now it breaks my heart and things need to change.
Yes! The weapons thing is so important.	First thing get the young crowd out the streets and take the weapons away a 7 year old passed this weekend because of this it is so heart breaking.
Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.	Found out recently that one of my best friends from back home died in an accident.
I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.	Thank you. I don't even have it in me to call her parents and offer my condolences yet, it's just too shocking.
That's great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.	I started my new job last week and already I feel part of the team.
That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.	It is and that's why I was nervous but the staff was so kind and open.
That's awful! What did you do?	One time someone kicked my dog!
No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?	Nothing! My dog was just walking passed him!
Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.	I got laid off from a job that I really used to love.
it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!	Sort of, the company was being run into the ground by poor management. It hurt at first but then I realized just how much I'd started to hate the work and the company.
Oh no, that's the worst.	I can't believe I lost my phone today while running errands.
I hope you can get it back somehow!	Sad part is I have no idea which store that's why I am so upset.
That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?	"I ended up on one of those ""Top 40 under 40"" lists for people in my profession. Felt pretty good."
I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!	Finance, basically, but it was a little broader than that. I wish my mom were still around, she would have been so happy.
That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?	I was shocked my husband bought me flowers today out of the blue.
Were they your favorites?	Nope not at all, that's why I was so shocked!
Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?	I was so grossed out about the molded bread I bought today.
That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.	I tried to, but they had a no refund policy.
Wow that must have been amazing!	Seeing my kids face when I finally brought a puppy home was priceless!
They're going to remember that forever	It really was, and I got it on video too.
Dang, that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?	While my car was parked on the street in front of my house last week, someone ran into it and left a huge dent.
Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?	No, they didn't leave a insurance card or anything, just drove off. Some people are so worthless.
Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.	Last month my dog Skippy passed away. He was 18 years old.
Oh, Did something happen to him?	Man it's hard. He has been like my best friend since I was a teenager.
I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.	My dog died of old age today.
Me neither, but in the end, I really didn't think about him as a dog, he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.	I am sorry that happened too. I never thought I would be this upset over a dog.
That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?	I waited the longest three weeks of my life to get something I ordered online.
At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.	It got worse. When it finally arrived, the box was all busted up and my item was broken. So yeah, safe to say they had a lot to make up for.
I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for?	My husband has been getting on my nerves worrying about his football team losing.
I don't even know what team that is, haha. Football is lost on me.	He is crazy about the Falcons.
Oh that's good, last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country	I am also sure I fixed my computer today.
I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset	That would be a nightmare! All I had to do was replace the fan.
Oh my goodness, is he with the armed forces?	My husband was just sent to Iraq and I already miss him so much.
I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker, I do want to say thank you to you,  him and your family for your sacrifice.	Yes the army, he will be there for 2 years.
That is horrible, did anyone get hurt?	I am in shock ever since my house caught on fire while I was at work.
Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.	No, thank goodness no one was home, but their is nothing left of our house.
That is scary.  What was it?	One time I heard a large knock on my door while I was sleeping
Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?	It was a couple of drug addicts trying to come in!
Sorry to hear that. What happened on the test?	i have very low mark
Hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!	exam mark is low in school
He must be very smart	am so happy for my brother, he graduated with honors
It paid off. Wish I was smart like that	yah, he had done his best
Oh no. How old are you?	I am alone in the house my parents travelled, i feel lonely and afraid
Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?	am 22 years of age
I'm sorry to hear that.	I feel lonely my friend did not make to join me i watching a movie
I hope things are better next time.	yah, i decided to sleep
That's great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!	Today is my anniversary! My husband planned an amazing day! He bought me my favorite chocolates and is taking me to a concert tonight! I had no idea about the concert!
Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!	He usually doesn't do this much! I guess after years of hinting, he's finally picking up on them! haha
Congrats <3	haha yeah it does! we've been together almost 15 years.
Not yours? That is so weird, usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol	I had my front door open and a cat (not mine) ran in my house.
Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers!	I know! we were all surprised. My god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out.
That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!	This has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area. This past spring we spent 5 hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area.
Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!	Yes, a lot of people don't have basements, and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark, scary place, especially when the power is all out.
Oh my goodness, are you alright? I bet you created a mess!	I was in the grocery store. I found what I needed on the top shelf. I climbed onto the bottom shelf but ended up knocking everything down!
I hope you can laugh a little about it now!	yeah! The only thing that was hurt was my pride! I've never tried to check out so quickly!
That sounds like a great gift. That is going to be a great time.	My favorite band is doing their last tour. My husband bought me tickets to see their concert! He surprised me with them today!
Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.	It is! I'm really excited for it! It's tonight, so it was also a big surprise!
I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog	Last month, my dog Duke passed away. I got him when he was just a puppy 17 years ago.
That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point	Yeah, we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.
That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?	I was driving around my old neighborhood and seen that the house I grew up in had burned down.
I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.	I spent birth till I was 17 living there, so literally all of my child hood memories.
That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.	my wife got a flat tire on her way home from work and a man was kind enough to stop and help her change the tire.
Someone was watching over her.	As was I. I was about 50 miles away at the time and she was on the side of the highway.
How long had you been married ?	Just over 2 years ago, my wife and I got divorced. It was so strange being in our big house all alone without her and the kids.
Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.	Just short of 9 years. She met someone online in WoW of all places and just up and moved in with him.
I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.	Back when I was in college, I crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket.
Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.	Exactly, especially when you get one for just walking.
Cool, what are you getting?	My wife and I are going to buy are very first brand new car this week.
That's a nice car, you are going to enjoy it.	A Chevy Cruze. We have been working hard to get our credit score up to get a really good interest rate.
Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?	I took my three children camping recently, and we had a great time.
That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain	Of course!  I have found that the key to a great camping experience is to have a checklist of what to bring, and follow it.
The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.	My daughter finally master the 1-6 times. We worked very hard on it this summer!
I bet she was super excited to get it all down.	Yes in multiplication! I'm glad she's finally grasped them. Now we just need to work on 6-12 hahaha
What grade is she in?	My daughter starts public school for the first time in 3 years! I think she is going to do great but she's a little bit nervous.
What kind of school was she at before?	She is in 5th grade.
Where did you go ?	Me and my family just came back from vacation we had a great time.
We went there a few years back. Had a great time.	We went to Disney world in Orlando,Fl to see my kids have a great time made me happy can't wait for our next vacation.
Awesome news!  What was the response?	Well, I finally got a call back from that job I interviewed for the other day.
Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!	Well, they decided not to hire me. This stinks.
That's awesome, I bet you were overjoyed with it!	My wife held a surprise birthday party for me. It was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I came home and so many people were there.
You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you, that's true!	I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.
Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?	Last week during the night someone came into my yard and stole my push mower.
Yeah, thieves are terrible.  I mean, who would steal a mower?	No, I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post, but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves.
what did you do?	My food had hair in it at a restaurant worst experience ever.
yea i can see that, it happens but it sucks	I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite.
well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either.	I'm not one to like scary movies that much only with my husband since he loves them so much.
Oh no, no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even.	We watched the new movie IT I was a little frightened and creep out especially because I'm afraid of clowns lol.
That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?	My wife is going away on a business trip soon.... she'll be gone for a couple of weeks.
I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.	Well, I might do some work on the house. But it's going to be awfully quiet around here.
spray water over there	Ugh, my neighbor keeps playing his music really loud at night when I'm trying to sleep.
thats good, you should	Ha, that's not a bad idea. I do need to have a word with him about it though at least.
Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?	Someone at work keeps stealing my lunch from the fridge! So infuriating!
What would you do to them?	I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!
Yea, I used to hate it too.	I don't like the dark.
Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?	I get so worried about something happening to me.
is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly	I've been stuck for several weeks on a part in this video game I've been playing...
yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games	It's pretty tough. But it doesn't matter now... I let a friend of mine have a try, and he got through it right away! It was pretty impressive to see.
That's pretty impressive, does he have any training or just all self taught?	So the fiance managed to rewire one of the wall outlets yesterday!
Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!	A little bit of both!  I didn't know he had these skills but it was really neat to watch!
That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!	Ugh, my neighbor's dog just keeps barking all day long. It's driving me insane.
I am sure he thinks it's his world, the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude	It really is. And I've talked to him a few times about it, but he doesn't seem to care at all.
Well you must be happy about it.	My brother is getting out of jail next week.
Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.	Not really... I'm the one that turned him in. And I'm scared that he might know about that.
I hope you hear good news.	I have a Dr appointment tomorrow to make sure my cancer is still in remission.
I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.	I think I will. It's been 7 years since my last treatment. I still get nervous when I have my checkups though.
It was nice of you to buy him food, but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back.	My brother is supposed to be paying me back for the food I bought for him last week...
I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it, and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.	Nope, I've been waiting for a few days, and I could really use that money now.
Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.	I stepped out of my front door this morning... and right into an unpleasant surprise that my neighbor's dog left for me.
Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.	Yeah.... the smell was so bad. It took forever to get that off of my shoe.
That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.	I got a phone call from a friend that I haven't heard from in a really long time.
I bet you had tons of catching up to do!	I was! It was so great hearing from her again.
The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?	I have a meeting with my boss in a few hours...
Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be, then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you	See, that's the thing... I have no idea what to expect. That's why I'm so nervous about it.
That is unfortunate, my own mother was ill for several years, she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?	My mother is getting very old. And she really isn't in great health these days...
Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.	Yeah, I try to go see her at least twice a week. I'm not sure how much longer she'll be with us.
That was great of him!	When I was out of work my car broke down and since it was my only car a friend of mine actually gave me his old car to replace it. It was such a nice gesture.
He sounds very nice!	It was. I insisted that I pay him after I got a job but he wouldn't take the money.
Oh really what was the assignment	I finished a major work assignment in a short amount of time
It's always great to get back positive feedback!	It was a presentation that had to be quickly put together.  My supervisor seemed pleased
What was it like when it showed up on your door?	I remember when the PS4 was first launching.  It was the first game console I ever ordered onilne and I was really looking forward to having it delivered.
Thats hilarious, You finally got it though uhuh?	I was watching the front door like a hawk, and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.
Im sure they had a good excuse.	A friend was supposed to meet me for lunch, but didn't show
Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.	He said he was busy with work, so I suppose so
Oh crap! how long untill you realized?	I accidentally left my phone at a restaurant
Thats so good, man I have done that a time of two.	A few minutes after leaving, I was able to get it back
I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!	I'm sure I will pass my law exam.
Congratulations. You have done great!	Thank you. I'm almost done with school!
That's really cool. What kind of car?	A friend got a new car
That  sounds like a really awesome car!	BMW, it was a model I had been looking to get myself
Aww, that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?	I carry around the ticket stub from the first concert I attended in my wallet.  It brings back good memories I had spending time with my friends.
I was going to say, yeah, that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!	The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.  Maybe I'll frame it someday.
Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.	Yeah, it's a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times.  It was a great concert and experience for all of us.
that stinks. what did you do?	Hey, the other day I didn't have a pen while trying to fill out some paperwork
and did you find one?	Yeah! Well I was in a parking garage so I went walking to try and find someone to borrow a pen from
oh that is awesome. and you got a fancy pen out of it	I did, this really nice woman just gave me a very fancy one. She told me to keep it!
Did it went well?	Hi! I had ear surgery a few months ago
That is great. What was the issue with your ear?	Yeah it went really well actually, the result was better than I had hoped for in fact!
you made quick work out of that	I moved over the weekend.  Although it took about 5 hours to load the truck, when we unloaded the next day it took a little under an hour.
i wish i could unload that fast	Yeah, I was really happy that the unloading took as little time as it did.
oh goodness. that has happened to me before. i could not sleep	I was scared of the spider in my bathroom.
how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?	It was a brown recluse. I had no clue that I had poisonous spiders at my house.
OOOOOOOOOO NICE!	My girlfriend moved in this past weekend.  I am really excited to start this next chapter in my life.
Well you two have fun tonight.  I won't tell your parents about all this.	Yeah, I'm excited.  First girlfriend that I've lived with but she is pretty awesome so I'm glad it finally happened.
Why you need to thank her? Is she the one that helped you to find the new job?	I got a new job and it is so great and I have my old supervisor to thank she's the best.
She is very nice person. That is great.	She was a great influence and gave me words of encouragement to branch out and go for more then our company job.
Oh. Will he be starting elementary school?	I am nervous about my son starting school this year.
aw he's at that precious age where you have to let his hand go, hu?	Yes, he will be starting Kindergarten this year.
Damn why'd you have to tell me that...Gawd that's freakin sad, jeezus	My dog had cancer and the vet advised us to put our dog to sleep today.
I wish you and your fam peace happiness love and good health.	I am soo upset, and worse I have to tell the kids when they get home.
What? Do you have evidence supporting this	I am so mad my neighbor killed my dog because she was mad at me.
Good hope that bitch goes to hell...sorry I love animals and my mom's dog died the same way	I sure do I have it on video and made a report with the police already.
That is a big deal.  What are you going to do?	I am so annoyed my neighbor's trash always ends up in my yard.
I would throw trash in their yard.	I have tried everything, but they keep doing it even after paying huge fines.
He sounds like a real hero though. I hope he comes home safe soon	My husband has been on his second tour in Iraq. Seems like I wont see him in forever.
I can only imagine. At least you have each other	Thank you, The kids and I miss him terribly.
Are you and your family okay?	I lost everything in the fire today.
I am sorry, you can replace it though	We are thank heavens, but we lost everything.
Wow!  How kind is that!  Their really are kind people left in this world.  How did you respond?	I once left all cash and didn't have any to pay for a metro ride, some random girl paid for me without saying a word.
*There* oops.  Did you ever find out her name?  Or find out a way to thank her?	Yes, and I am thankful for those kind of people.
On no! Did you have to walk, or did you call for service?	Last week on the way to work, I did not notice my wife had ran my car so low on gas and I ended up running out of gas on the freeway.
Wow, you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?	A nice man stopped, help me push my car to the shoulder and even had a can of gas he let me use in his trunk. Talk about a nice guy.
Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.	I got caught cheating on my test. I feel so horrible.
Well, don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on, and do you best not to repeat it.	I just wanted to make sure I passed. But now I have a big 0.
That's so sad! What on earth happened?	I had an accident today and I never want to show my face again at work.
Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?	I accidentally peed my pants when I was laughing.
That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.	My daughter made straight A's all year. I am so happy.
Awww, what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?	Yes I agree. I let her choose our vacation this summer. She cried because she was so happy.
You are such a good person to do that!	I could never send my parents to a nursing home. I look after them now.
It's crazy how the tables turn!	Thank you! They say they feel like they are the kids and it makes them feel young again.
Why do you say that	I think I will never walk into the local grocery store again.
Oh no, were you okay	It was raining today, and when I walked into the store I slipped and fell right on my face.
Oh my goodness, what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business, am I right!?	I can't show my face in the bank ever again!
That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches, that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back.	How did you guess? You are exactly right. Now they are talking about alerting the police!
have you asked your friends for family?	I need someone to stay with my elderly mother for a few hours in my home.
i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them	No one is available. She asked someone that I don't know and they are coming. I am a little uneasy.
Oh yeah? And what news might that be?	My husband just told me the best news ever!
Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?	My husband just signed with the NFL. I never knew he was that good!
Oh my goodness, that's terrible!	So, I just found our my husband is cheating on me.
What do you plan on doing?	I am soo mad. I can't believe he did this after being married for 15 years.
uh oh. did something happen?	I don't think I will go outside in the dark ever again.
That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.	Yes, I was robbed at gun point while walking home from work.
Do you think you will get the job?	I have been pacing waiting to hear back from Walmart after my interview.
I hope you end up getting it!	Not sure, but I really need this job to support my kids.
Oh definitely, Youtube is a great platform for these talented people	I like to watch all the music and guitar covers on YouTube.  There's a lot of talented folks out there nowadays.
Yeah, my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens	Yeah, it never ceases to amaze me the kinds of things you can see on YouTube.  Endless content to discover.
do you think there something wrong	I am still waiting to hear the results from the doctor.
oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that	They think I may have brain cancer. I can't seem to even sit still waiting for that phone call.
Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!	I am waiting to find out if I really won the lottery.
You and I both! No matter who wins, let's promise to split the pot.	Wow. I spent $500.00 myself. I hope it pays off!
Oh nice, where are you going?	I will be going on a once in a life time trip tomorrow.
Wow, I've never been on a cruise before. I think it sounds like a lot of fun	I will be going on my first cruise.
Why? What did she do?	I can never thank my mom enough.
She is a special woman.	She helped us pay off our house so it didn't go into foreclosure.
I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.	I am not sure how to address to my husband about how I feel about him getting a phone number from another girl.
Oh, he certainly will when he feels the hot, guilty tears running down his face from that strong, independent, jealous filled slap!	That is how I feel. I don't think he understands how it makes me feel inside.
Was any of your stuff damaged?	I am still in shock at the damage yesterdays flood caused.
Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.	Yes, our whole house was swept out to sea.
Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?	I know I got this job, just waiting for the conformation.
Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!	No, this is the first job I have ever had just out of high school.
Oh geez! What on earth was it!	I never thought I would see something this gross ever!
That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!	I saw a guy pick a piece of chewed gum off the sidewalk and put it in his mouth.
No way. What happened? If honestly, almost all my days are like this. So, worst has become normal for me	Today, was the worst day ever!
Don't get it personally. Good performance will always catch other's attention. Just continue doing your work	That is so sad. I was turned down for my promotion at work to someone with less experience than me.
That's awesome! Always good to be content with life.	I am pretty happy with my life right now.
It's good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen.	It took a long time. But I always tell people to plan for the future!
Definately! I have one daughter and twins on the way... I foresee love overload. How many do you have?	I never knew I would feel this much love having kids.
Thanks, Motherhood truly is amazing	Congrats. I love every bit of motherhood. I have 3 kids. They are 7,5, and 2
Not really, do you?	Do you felt sad or emotioned during your work
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, i hope it picks up for you, maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits	Some time I felt disgusted with my work
Oof, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I guess	I didn't think I would feel this bad for stealing diapers.
Well you tried to make things right, you're still a good person	I felt so bad I brought them back. I am happy I wasn't arrested. But it was only half a pack I brought back.
i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me. are you?	Do you feel that you are satisfied with your work
im glad to hear that!	Great! I am very happy with work, I am loving it
What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?	I would be in bad shape if I didn't pack extra clothes.
What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?	We went on vacation. And we all ended up with the stomach virus so you can guess from there lol
What concert is it? Are you excited to go?	I am still shocked my husband bought tickets to the concert.
OH MY GOD, I'm so jealous, she isn't coming to my city this time. You're gonna have a great time	Super excited to see Taylor Swift! He knew I was a fan.
Wow, that will be a busy house	I just found out I was having twins. I already have 3 kids.
That's a great attitude, I hope you and your family stay happy and healthy	Yes, I agree. I was super worried, but decided to think more positive and I know I will be able to handle it.
What did you lie about, are you going to tell him?	I feel so bad lying to my husband.
HAHAHA if anything that is excusable, noone like inlaws!	I might as well since I feel so bad. I pretended to be sick because I didn't want to spend 3 days at my in law's house this holiday weekend.
How scary! I'm terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here	There have been more tornadoes in my area this year so far than any year in recent memory. We have spent a lot of time in the basement.
Well I hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!	It's so much worse when the power is out and all we have is a few candles and flashlights.
Wow, that's very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?	my husband threw me an unexpected party for my birthday!
That's too bad. I hope you had a blast!	Yes almost my entire family! The only one that wasn't there was my son. He couldn't come because he had to work.
That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.	There is suppose to be a huge storm coming. I went to the store and got supplies so i am ready.
I've done that as well where nothing ends up happening but I bought all this stuff. You never know what could happen though.	We usually don't have horrible storms so i never do it, but i have heard this one is going to be a bad one.  i just want to be ready
Where are you going on vacation?	I am looking forward to going on vacation in october! i need a vacation
That should be fun, what do you plan to do there?	My husband and i are going to the smokeys.  I have been but he hasn't.
That must of been horrible.	I was walking through walmart and noticed people staring. i went to the bathroom and to check my clothing and i had a huge brown stain on my rear! i sat in chocolate, i was moritified
I am sure people forgot already.	I can't stop thinking about it.  I keep replaying the scene in my head, it was so bad.
What job is it?	I am suppose to start a new job tomorrow. I am not sure I am going to like it
Only one way to find out.	i will be working at a daycare. i love kids, but i am not sure i will like working with so many at once.
What branch of the military then?	My son is getting ready to go into the military! I am so pleased with him
The marines is by far my favorite so good for him!	The marines. He has always wanted to join.  I am glad he is finally getting to.
Oh no that's horrible. Have you complained to the electric company?	My electricity is out again! I pay a lot for the service, and i can never count on it. It goes out when the wind blows!
I would too at this point. It might be more reliable.	Yes but i always get the same answer, we are working to improve the infrastructure.. blah blah. I am seriously considering solar.
That will be no fun.	I think I am going to have to serve on a jury and I am terrified
Don't you have to be selected first?	No.  I hope it isn't a murder trial or something heartbreaking.
That sucks! i hate losing money as well.	I can't believe I lost at Bingo! I spent 40 dollars and didn't win a penny
That's how I always feel at those things as well!	Yes, I swear there were 5 people sitting all around me that won several games.  It's just not fair.
I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good.	Have you ever been to the zoo just to realize that animals can be just as good as humans?
I think it's a good outlook.	Yes, I am happy somebody shares this with me.
Hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own.	I almost adopted a child once, but now I'm glad I didn't do it, sometimes we should stay rational.
It's a tough choice to make, and not everyone has to raise a child.	I don't know if this is something I'll ever be ready for.
i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything	Have you ever mistaken a situation for something it is not and was ready for anything?
almost? so the situation resolved itself?	It's just that the other day I mistaken a guard for a tour guide and almost got in a fight.
What kind of interview?	I have an interview with a local ad agency tomorrow. I hope I get it!
Really? That is cool	An interview for a job.
How exactly?	yesterday my family surprised me on my birthday
I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.	well i came back from work kind of sad because i thought nobody remembered my birthday and as soon as i went inside they screamed happy birthday , not gonna lie i got really happy.
oh my god, how did you get out of there?	I got into a wrong part of town the other day, I was glad to get out from there.
that sounds great.	I realized I could walk very fast if I want to.
That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.	In the past and even today I always felt strong in unfamiliar situations.
Yeah it might just be something you're born with.	I agree, although I don't really know if you can train yourself to be like that.
I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.	I have old cassette player and music on it is much better than what I hear on a radio today.
Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.	Yes, today it's just all about money and getting physical.
how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?	yesterday i went to the town where i grew up
im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip	it did, so much nostalgia!
Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?	So it was supposed to rain, but when I got out it was beautifully sunny.
I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.	Sun is what makes me alive, so definitely yes.
i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though	When I walk past old people I feel fortunate that I'm still young.
def. make the best of them	Yes, but this part is inevitable, for now let us enjoy our young years.
It's good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.	When I feel an urge to get a girlfriend, I simply remember how nice it is to be independent.
Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.	Yes, I still think that there are good and bad sides in both of these cases.
I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. It's amazing how much people litter	I get angry when people don't use trash cans.
I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.	Good for you, instead of tickets this should be a punishment for everyone.
Are you in a dangerous place?	When I wake up, the first thing I do is thank life for having another day to enjoy.
I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!	No I'm not, but in away we all are in a very dangerous place, aren't we?
Oh no. Did it get ruined?	i was with my friend yesterday and by accident i spilled coffee on her laptop
Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while	i got so embarrassed but thankfully it didn't get ruined
Really? So sorry for the lose	my grandmother passed away last week.
Was she sick?	i'm really sad because she used to help me with everything
That's a bummer. It's never fun to not win.	I entered a contest and I didn't win.
Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!	No it isn't. I felt like I put a lot of effort into it too.
That's not good, we ended up lucky with who we have	we changed our internet provider last week and the connection is horrible.
Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok?	i wish we did too.. but it's okay
that's wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?	I was one of three finalists for a job promotion where I work. I have more than double the other candidates experience, so I feel really good about my odds.
Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate	I am a electrical engineer with more than 15 years experience. I have a really good feeling that I am going to get this job.
I agree, plus I love making snowmen!	i can't wait for summer to finish , i love winter so much
I always get sad though when they melt	snowmen are my favourite!
Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?	Last week I was walking and talking to one of my coworkers and I stepped into a hole I did not see on the job site. I ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client.
Of course! Well, at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.	Yeah, my coworker did, but the damage had already been done. Pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client.
That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?	We have had a record number of tornadoes in my area so far this year. My son really hates going into the basement while it is storming outside.
I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.	He is only three, so it is pretty scary for him each time. I hate to see him that way.
That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?	I had a client meeting in Dallas, and as I was driving to the airport I heard there was going to be a lot of storms we'd be flying through. I ended up renting a car because I hate flying so much in just calm weather.
I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped.	I have, but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.
Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?	Last month, this area got pounded with rainfall. My entire home town was flooded and declared a disaster area.
Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.	No, I move away from there some years ago, but I hate seeing the place I grew up basically destroyed now.
That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?	My birthday isn't for another two weeks, but my wife gave me my gift early yesterday. She bought me a brand new laptop because mine was getting old and slow.
Is that a gaming computer?	It's a Dell with a I7 and 8 gigs of ram, even has a Nvidia graphics card. She pretty much know what I wanted.
Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?	Last month our area received record amounts of rainfall. The river that is down from my house backed up so bad it flooded my entire house destroying practically everything.
I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.	Yes, we had insurance that is going to cover it, but it still sucks start from ground zero. Plus, insurance can't really replace some things.
Interesting....did you do it	My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster.
lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end	Yeah, but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it.
Why do you cheat on him?	My husband is so lucky I cheat on him like he did.
Oh I see, why are you still with him then?	I could have. But I didn't. He cheated on me actually.
I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?	Damn, I really wanted my eBay package to arrive today, but it didn't.
Haha, I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage.	Indeed, I thought everything came this early.
Yeah, the US is huge, landmass wise.	That sucks! I guess ground shipping takes ages in large countries.
You can always leave them an angry review online	I really really wished it would come today, I was even sat at the window looking for postal trucks and everything!
What did your dog do?	I got so mad at my dog the other day.
Oh no, well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.	He saw the rabbit that lives under my shed eating some grass in my yard, and decided to scare it and chase it away.
What happened to you?	I am so upset about what happened yesterday.
That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?	I accidentally can off the road avoiding a deer and totaled my new car.
Oh nice! I bet you'll remember that for a long time	I went to my first concert this weekend I seen Beyonce herself it was so awesome.
I've never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!	Yes and I will it was great and her voice and the singers really moved me because even in person it was lovely.
that's terrible! how does that make you feel?	This past weekend I found out a friend of mine I went to school with passed away. He had a heart attack while he slept.
That is the reality of life, unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now.	It makes me feel old. I mean I am not that old, but to see people my age passing away really makes me think about my own mortality.
That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?	I am upset I have to tell my daughter her pet died.
Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.	She had it for 2 years. But I feel I must be honest with her.
Where are you going?	I can't believe my husband planned a trip all by him.
That is going to be so fun!	I am still shocked he planned a cruise for 7 days.
I am never ready. which diet are you trying	I start my diet Monday and let's just say I am not ready to start lol.
I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started	The keto diet and I have started looking up meal preps and workouts but as of non I am so not arranged to start this up I need more time.
your welcome, and I will check out Keto.	I have to look into that one never heard of it thanks.
My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.	My dogs are my life more like my family I love them.
Exactly! I am glad you have them	Yes they are you can't be lonely with them they are just so warmhearted and loving always.
That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking, of course...	I can't believe my husband hid a talent her had from me for 15 years.
Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then, huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.	I happen to come across all his drawings. He is as good as most professional artists!
how is that working out for you	I am starting back dancing ballet next month it's been a while since I last danced.
practice makes perfect	A little rusty but I know when I get in the class and hit the floor with my shoes I am more then positive it will be great.
omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it?	I hate I keep receiving double bills every month from Comcast.
Sounds like a nightmare! total.	Every month they shut off my service because I didn't pay the second bill. Then I have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors.
Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?	When I see my wedding picture around the house I always think back to that day.
Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.	Yeah, just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now.
that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan	My favorite football team lost their preseason game and I talked so much smack to everyone saying they was going to win.
lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other	I love the Jaguars I was ashamed I talk a lot of smack to everyone lol I guess me and your uncle need to stay quite next time lol.
Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around	I dislike a careless driver and this morning I was furious with one by my daughters elementary school.
Thats awful! People should be arrested for that	I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt.
Oh no!  Devastating! I'm so sorry.	I lost some money yesterday in the parking lot I am still so unhappy about that.
That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!	I know it is I lost $100 and was actually on the way to pay my car insurance with that can't believe I was careless.
That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?	I decided to buy my son's supplies for kindergarten, they wanted very specific brands/counts.
That's annoying, maybe they should provide links for you next time?	I'm not sure, it was just on the list.  I had a really hard time finding them.
How did it go?	I just got out of a job interview for a customer assistant role.
That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating.	I think it went well, apart from a few mistakes, hopefully I got the job.
Oh no, what happened?	I recently had to babysit my cousins, it was a disaster.
There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.	They made a mess everywhere in the house. Really was not a good way to earn money.
So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?	Yesterday was my birthday and I knew my girlfriend had a surprise planned for me, but no idea what it would be.
She's must be a keeper then.	An awesome one! All my best friends were there and I got some pretty sweet gifts!
That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?	Against all odds, I won two tickets to go to a music festival last summer.
Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?	That's a shame! It was a festival called Pooza Fest. Many punk-rock and acoustic shows!
wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.	I won a pair of tickets to go to Rockfest this summer.
aww that stinks, i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money	I won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! Unfortunately, none of my friends could go and so I ended up staying home instead.
That is crazy! How is he still employed?	My coworker constantly calls in.  The last couple weeks he had only come in on Fridays.  We made a friendly bet last night if he would come in today and I was pretty shocked when he actually was here on a Wednesday.
That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.	He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.  It definitely doesnt look good for him though.
I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.	I told my best friends about an incident in where I self-harmed recently.
Thats what best friends are for, after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.	Agreed. I was anxious and scared to share, but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.
Gesh, that's frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.	My dog keeps going into my garbage and throwing it all onto the floor!
We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.	That's a good idea, I just haven't found a nice looking one yet. It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.
That is awe inspiring, very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?	An eagle landed on my flag pole in my front yard last week!
I'm sure, that isn't something you see every day, or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.	I did. Not the best pictures because I was using my phone but still, it was really surprising.
Well, that's great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important.	I've been putting off my exam studying by being productive in other areas of my life.
Yeah, that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive.	Yeah... I'm pretty upset in myself for procrastinating, but also proud of what I've been accomplishing. I'm so conflicted in my emotions.
I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.	I was helping my girlfriend pack up her sons toys and he had a lite-brite.  I used to have a lite-brite and loved playing with it when I was younger.  It brought back some good memories.
Nope, they only know how to touch screens.	His is a new version too...those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!
That's great! How long have you two been together?	My girlfriend moved in last weekend.  I really feel like this is the right move for the next steps for us and our relationship.
You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.	Almost a year.  We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.
Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.	A friend of mine hadn't taken out her garbage in weeks.
Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.	You got that right. Also there were so many fruit flies around it, I felt sick to my stomach.
Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile	I really hate moving. My girlfriend just moved in last weekend. Im really happy she moved in but Im also SUPER happy that the move is finally over.
I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious	Haha, the boxes are still being unpacked and probably will be for the next couple weeks.  I'm hoping we dont have to again for a while!
That sounds pretty amazing, what convention was it?	I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to volunteer for one of my favorite companies at a convention.
I'm so happy for you, it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!	Otakuthon 2018. It was so amazing, I ended up doing really great!
That is always so much fun. Which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?	i was looking at my old photo album today, it brought back a lot of memories
I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.	the one where i was eating ice cream, oh god i miss eating ice cream
oh yea? and what did they get you?	I told my family I wanted nothing a few Christmas' ago, even if I knew they'd get me something anyways.,4|5|5_5|5|5,
Oh nice.  Those are fun.  I love playing video games	I got an Xbox One, and I had no idea how much fun I'd have until I received it.
Oh yes? What happened?	I went for a run last month and the most unexpected thing happened to me.
Oh, that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.	I was running on a road with a sidewalk, I turned the corner and saw a deer staring at me. Can't believe I found one in my small suburban neighborhood.
That's not much fun. Did he get a new one recently?	My little brother was stuck gaming on a horrendously slow computer for years.
Wow, you're smart and kind! I wouldn't know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!	Kind of. I built myself a new PC, and gave him my previous one. I re-built it for him and made sure everything would work perfectly!
What a nice thing to do. You seem to get on very well with your little bro.	Thanks! Seeing him smile as he played with high frame rates and nice graphics brought me such joy.
I love my brother, too. He's a great guy. How lucky we are!	I love my siblings so much, they're the best.
Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.	My older sister stole money from me.
That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.	Yeah, no one else in the household would ever do something like that. The worst thing is, my parents did nothing about it.
I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it's stuff you miss!	Today I woke from an amazing dream which i had, it brought back a lot of amazing memories, memories which i wish i could go back to...
Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?	Yeah, but at the same time, it motivated me for the day which was nice
That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.	Last week as we were finishing up on a job site, the client was over joyed at the way we had done the installation. I couldn't help but keep smiling since it was my design.
You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.	Yes, it is great to see something you designed be put into a working model.
Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.	i was just like the usual, working on my website, and then i saw a disgusting advert which was about society
I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.	yeah, but i wish it wasn't like this
Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy. I would just unpack the necessities first and move from there.	My girlfriend moved in over the weekend.  We have a ton of boxes to unpack but I am thinking it should be something that can be done in the next couple weeks.
Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!	I think thats the plan.  After those were just slowly going to go from room to room until everything is done.  Not a huge rush and were both super happy...well I am.  I'm assuming she is too!
That would be a great feeling.  Did something happen to make you feel more content?	today i woke up, and i realised that i am more than content with my life, it made me happy and peaceful
Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.	yes, i just realised i have everything i ever wanted in my life
oh nice! i know that feeling, is it home? what made you think about going there?	Im going to Chicago in a couple weeks.  I havent been there for about 15 years so I'm really looking forward to it.
nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!	It isnt home but I went there for family trips when I was younger. My girlfriends friend is having a baby shower and lives there so I'm tagging along and were going to make a long weekend out of it!
yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about	I really don't like randomly pumping into old friends, it get's me nervous, and i saw one of my old friend's today and  i was surprised, to say the least
yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation?	yeah, so i tried to look for a way out before i admit defeat, but then i realised there was no way out and so i talked to them in the end
well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction	yeah it wasn't bad in the end, just awkward
Do you think they deserved it?	A co-worker of mine was fired at work
"Well as they say, ""Better them than you"""	No, their performance seemed to be good
that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress	Today my wife worked super hard for our future and made an amazing progress
that is good hard work and determination will always pay off	thank you, in a few months everything will work out perfectly
thats a really good feeling isnt it? anything in particular?	today i was walking outside and then suddenly had a moment where i realised how amazing my life is
Thats awesome.  Im glad youre happy.  keep the positive energy flowing	just how i have everything i ever wanted, and that made me feel very grateful
Im guessing it wasnt your fault? Do you know whos it was?	I got accused of something at work today.
That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious.	I wasn't even at work the day it happened, yet they still insist it was me.
Did they not ever come?	I watched out the window for visitors to my house today, it was saddening.
Man that's a bummer.  I'd visit you but that would be weird.	No one came to visit.
That is awesome.  What kind of designs are there?	today my wife and i decorated our house and made amazing designs on our bedroom walls, i am so proud of us
That is very very cool.  I would love something like that in mine	a rabbit near her and a owl near my side of the bed and random marks everywhere else
Its always nice getting praise and compliments.  I hope everyone was proud of you	work was fun, my manager told everyone about the amazing work i put in
Thats great.  I hope you get a raise too	they are, and i am very proud of myself
Like what?	My dog was bit by something and had a huge front lip and looked really sad.  I felt terrible for him and was doing anything I could to help.
Wow that's really compassionate of you	I took him to the vet who checked it over and determined he was bit.  They suggested benedryl and rest for a couple days until it went down.
Are you feeling much more motivated now? What do you want to achieve?	I was looking though the window today and the beautiful sight outside the window gave me a positive outlook on life and made me realise to work harder for my future
Thats such fantastic goals to aim for in life! I wish you all the best.	i am feeling motivated, i want to be financially free and continue to learn and develop myself even more
Happy Birthday.  That was so nice of them.  I bet you were surprised.  Was there cake?	It was my birthday today, so my family organised a party that I didn't know about.
haha that sounds quite messy, but I hope that it atleast tasted good	Oh yeah, the surprise was the cake being thrown in my face!
I agree, you need money for everything these days and it controls us.	money is such a weird thing, still don't agree with this ideology but it is the way things have been inherited since the start, i just wish it wasn't so controlling, i am worried about my future income
Me too, I try not to worry about money so much. There's more to life than that.	yeah i will continue to work hard on my finance and make sure it doesn't control me
I hope your work continues on the path you want and expect.	my work is going well and i am happy with the outcome with everything and i am feeling hopeful
Hard work is supposed to payoff, right?	thank you and i hope you do so too, let's work hard!
I know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast. Do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep.	i am feeling very guilty recently as i am putting a lot of stress on my body and not sleeping enough, it's making me feel very bad
If you get sick you won't be able to work at all so please take care of yourself.	i know i should, but it's been very rough recently with work and all
What happened?	I won't listen to anyone anymore, what i know now is that i trust my guts! that always works out well for me
Wow, that's cruel.	as usual i decided to listen to my father, he told me to come back to my home city and said he has a job there, so i could quit mine, but when i went there he lied, and now i don't have a job
Yeah that is a pretty good mindset to go by.	i anticipate my future, if i continue to work always and chase after my dreams i will climb that mountain
Just keep it up and you will go far.	thank you, i hope it goes well for you too
that is great! I'm also learning to write code.	I believe in my abilities more now, i am surprised but today i managed to write amazing 3 line code to do the base 64 decode process
HTML/CSS/Java. I'm excited about a career change.	oh really? what language on?
why is that?	I was nervous for my mom's surprise party
oh god yes i know what you mean, any ideas what you wanna do ?	Not sure if everyone who RSVP'd would show up. People are so flaky these days.
uhoh, did you get lost?	I decided to go a new route home from school today, but it didn't turn out as planned.
oh that is scary.  I hope you were ok.  make sure your doors are locked	No, it just took me somewhere dodgy.
what was wrong with it	I was able to get my car fixed
good luck! we just had our mini cooper blow its engine yesterday .. $12.5k to replace	Engine issues, I'm praying it will last a bit longer now
Well music does have a really cathartic effect on people.	today i listened to one of my old time favourite music and it moved my emotions and made me joyful
He can have a great impact on your brain and feeling that is for sure	yup, it's also a digital drug
Wow!  That's a horrible prank!  I would be crying!  What did you do when your friend gave it back?	oh god today! my friend stole my laptop as a prank and gave it back to me late at night
I would have been really mad as well!  Hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again!	i punched him, i was so mad and furious
I'm sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I ask what happened today to make it so weird?	today is a weird day, i'm just feeling so emotional
Oh, I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like you're a really self-aware person, and appreciative of the small things, and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of	it's not a bad feeling so dont be sorry, it happens every now and then, just makes me realise how grateful i am to be alive
thats crazy. and scary.  WHat happened?	I almost died today coming home from work.
im so sorry.  I hope youre ok	Crashed the car, totalled it too.
Getting paid is always a good thing. Were you waiting to get something special?	I'm so excited to get my paycheck in.
You deserve one. Did you get it?	My boss said there might be the possibility of a raise this month.
I hate it when that happens! Were they driving fast at the time, it could have been quite dangerous.	I was driving and someone cut me off in traffic
I can imagine, at least you got out of the situation safely	Not too fast, it was still irritating though
That's awesome. I think it's great that you stepped up to repay your loans!	I picked up a 2nd job last year and today made my last student loan payment
Oh man, well I hope that it was worth it to take out those loans.	Yes, I'm so thankful it's done. It has taken me 15 years. Now only 15 more for my wife's loans
That is such a long time to live in loneliness. I suggest you do, dogs are great companions	I have lived alone for the last 10 years some day's I think I should get a dog.
Sounds like a great idea! That would be very nice of you to give a dog a home	I was thinking I'll go to resume and adopt who ever has been their the longest.
Wow, congratulations!!  Are you guys excited?	Just found out my wife is pregnant
I know the feeling!  My son is a year old so I remember it well haha.	Excited and Terrified
You get a new trim?	Went to the Barber today. I'm one beautiful man.
That's awesome, bet you look straight out of 1990s.	I went old school. Last a bet now I have a mullet with lighting bolts on the side and a stash.
What did you guys get up to?	I met up with an old friend from school
What do you miss the most?	We just talked about the way things used to be
that is awesome. what did he make you?	My husband cooked me my favorite food today! He never cooks!
that sounds yummy. i'm glad you had that special treat.	Bacon egg and cheese on toast! It was amazing! He makes the best fried eggs.
Do you know what kind of dog?	I saw a dog running earlier, it was insane how fast she went!
Those things can really fly on the ground.	Miniature Pinscher!
Oh no! I bet she was mad as heck	Last time I got really drunk, I told my girlfriend that I thought her best friend was really attractive.
Oh hey! If it works out for you have fun	Actually, she wasn't. She knew I was drunk, and she had been talking about involving another partner in the bedroom.
Gross! Out of all the bugs that I find in my house, those would be the worse.	I was sweeping the living room today and found a roach! Ugh.
Knowing roaches, they'd probably survive it, seeing as they can pretty much survive anything!	I know! I feel like I need to bomb my house!!!
Oh no! Did he pass?	My little brother was sad and didn't think he would pass his summer school this year.
That's great!! Hopefully he will do good in school this year and not have to go to summer school again!	He did and I'm so happy for him!
That's great. Maybe a promotion or a raise in on the horizon?	I have an interview with my boss tomorrow about my performance. I've compiled all of my work from the past month as well as great reviews from our clients!
Well I hope that it goes well for you!	I'm hoping for both! but I'll take just the raise!!
Nice! I hope you get this job if you worked hard for it	I'm interviewing for a higher position at my job I am so excited.
Just have faith in your abilities and the rest will come by itself	I have and thanks so much I know I got this I'm positive of that all my hard work will pay off and I'm going to do great on Monday for the interview.
I'm sure its always fun to view the progress of your creations.	My oldest is a chef and it is moving to see how far she has grown the past year.
That sounds nice, having someone prepare a meal for you can be fun.	It is and me and my family got to see those great creation this weekend she made us a fabulous dinner.
oh yea.. whats happened since then	About the same time last year, I went out with a friend for a sushi, it was a very pleasantly spent time.
oh well that sounds pleasant	Not much really, we just had a small chat, but it just felt really satisfying.
Did it feel good to get back out?	I went for a run tonight despite feeling super depressed these past two weeks.
How far did you end up running tonight?	It felt amazing, I'm so happy I was able to push myself onto the right track.
How did you do?	I took a big end of the semester exam it had 200 questions I was so nervous.
Oh wow! Congrats! That's great!	I was so stun to see I only missed 7 out of 200 I was so happy to have aced my test.
It is it's something we all have as humans it's not defined by gender show off your emotions proud.	When growing up, I was repeatedly told that emotions are for the girls, but now I know that emotions are a big part of everybody's lives.
It really is why would someone make you feel like it was for girls only especially being young but you are great now.	Yes, and it's a good news for us all.
He should be ashamed for himself, did he say why he did it?	My brother in law stole from me and my husband I am so mad.
Well, on the other hand you can think of this situation, as if you just paid $500 to a person to never bother you again.	No we haven't seen him or he won't return none of the family calls he took our $500 and disappeared,
Have you hugged him recently?	My husband is in the service and he leaves when on active duty I be missing him so much.
I'm sorry to hear that, he is a brave man.	No he has been gone for 5 months now I can't wait to hug him though so for now I sleep in his shirts it seems like the closet I can get and it is so dear to me to wear it.
Did something ruin it?	Yesterday I woke up in such a great mood, that I was ready to face any problem or opportunity.
well thats not too bad	Nothing really, except some indigestion much later in the day.
I can't think of a certain moment that the idea clicked. It seems like I've always known they can.	Do you remember your first time realizing hat people can actually lie?
What was that moment for you?	Lucky you, I have a sharp memory of that moment.
Im sorry but I am laughing. I bet you were so embarrassed.	So itt was me who spent hours in a work seminar with my zipper down and shirt on backwards lol.
I would imagine. Just own it and wear it like a badge.	It is pretty funny now but at the time I was red face it was awkward I know lot's of people noticed it lol.
Its nice to have the internet	My wi-fi just started working again, that makes me very happy.
I cannot even imagine	How did people live without it just a couple decades ago?
Sounds very relaxing to me, as long as my allergies don't act up.	Sunflower seed and sunny weather is a good combination for a relaxed day do you afree?
I always keep some propolis pills with me just in case.	That's right we have to keep those in mind.
What happened that made you have to do that?	Yesterday, I was in a situation where I had to stand up for myself.
OH goodness!  Are you ok?	Just some drunken guy, tried to attack me.
I enjoy sunny weather too.	I knew there is a chance for some sun later in the day, when I went out yesterday.
They must enjoy the rain.	Yes, how do people live in those cloudy cities like Seattle?
Oh no, I'm sorry hun. I hope you're at least moving for a good reason like better opportunities.	I am moving to a different city soon, I feel a bit depressed about that.
Well there is at least one positive. Maybe you could try joining some meet up groups to help you acclimate.	Yes, it should at least be better for me financially.
I do almost everyday I feel like that is a great mindset to have to make your day successful.	Have you ever woken up like like you are ready to conquer the world today?
They are but to just be able to continue throughout another day is a great feeling.	I am glad we have this in common, many people are so negative in this world.
I agree, do you have a favorite artist?	I love going to museums and art galleries the art and sculptures is a sight to see.
Yes, he is great no wonder his work is so expensive.	I love Vincent van Gogh his paintings are so moving and a lot of the art shows are close to his creativeness.
That's good. Did you find out the results of the test?	I recently had to take a test for work. I knew I would do well because I was prepared.
Good luck on the exam!	Not yet. I should find out within the next week.
What does providence mean?	Some things in my life can only be described by word - providence.
Okay, tell me more about that.	Means something extraordinary, like higher power.
That's great. Does he do photography as a job or a hobby?	I feel happy for my brother that he is a good photographer.
Maybe he can turn it into a career and make a lot of money!	Just as a hobby. But he's good at it.
That sounds wonderful!  I've never been on a cruise, I bet you are excited and ready to go!	I have a cruise planned for me and my family labor day weekend.
I know that feeling all too well.  Too much to do and not enough time to do it all, and certain things you can't do until the week of.  Hopefully you will get it all done and then you guys will have a great time!	Me either it will be a first for us all I am very excited only thing we are not arranged and ready yet we still have lot's to do.
Wow what kind of dog did you lose?	Our family dog was stolen a week ago and our home haven't been the same.
That's so tragic I have 3 dogs myself, do you have flyers up?	A teacup yorkie I miss her so much I have been so heart broken since they stole her while we was out shopping. Had to be someone who was watching us and waited until we left.
Oof, I hope that doesn't wake you up	My girlfriend's cat randomly walks over my head in the middle of my sleep.
Maybe it doesn't fell very comfortable with having you over and doesn't have any other way of expressing itself	It does, and I get so upset. Apparently she doesn't ever do it to my girlfriend, only when I come over.
that's cool.  Do you celebrate both of them on the same day?	My girlfriend and I have birthdays 8 days apart.
haha I bet.  That's pretty awesome!	We do! Exchanging gifts makes it feel like Christmas in the summer and it made me so happy.
oh no. did something bad happen?	So today I let my co worker draw my blood knowing she is a novice!
That;s great. I have always been nervous no matter who drew my blood.	It actually went well. I felt I could give her the benefit of the doubt considering she has been doing really well recently.
She is going to be great at that job	I agree! I',m the same way, but even more since she is new, but I had confidence in her
Oh no. How'd they react?	I went to call a patient back to be seen and I addressed them as Mrs and the person that walked up was a male.
I'd be super embarassed, too!	He didnt get upset.. He said it happens alot, but I can feel my face get red!
Wow, that's horrible, I hope he calmed down after and apologized to everyone	My dad came home from a bar really drunk one night, and started instigating fights with everyone in the household.
Yikes, I would definitely stage an intervention with the rest of your family, let him understand it's not okay	Unfortunately, no. Despite him scaring everyone, he did not care.
I remember those	When I was a kid, my friends brought their BeyBlades to school to play
I never had one. I didnt know they were expensive	They were awesome and I wanted one so badly, but my parents could not afford it. I felt very bitter towards my friends for a while after.
That's great! I hope you keep getting good reviews like that.	I had my review today at work! It went really well since the doctor has been giving me compliments!
That's awesome. How much do you anticpate the raise to be?	Yeah im very happy to know what comes next, since I will find out how much of a raise I will get from this. I cant wait!
oh thats cool, is she good ?	My girlfriend recently found herself a new hobby in sewing
oh thats cool	She's super talented. She made a few dresses and cosplay within a month.
oh that sounds like it will be very rewarding!	I put a lot of effort and time into getting into a college program I wanted to be in.
a tough situation but at least you were able to realize and adapt!	Unfortunately, I had to switch majors; the program was too difficult to stay in and my mental health was deteriorating.
Oh god. The living room is shared. She should just leave the messiness in her room.	My sister leaves her clothes all over the living room.
How old is she?	I agree completely! I get so irritated and I always tell her to clean up after herself, but she seems so very lackadaisical.
I'm so sorry to hear that. How old is the cat?	My girlfriend's cat is sick with Cancer.
All you can do is make sure she's not in too much pain as she goes.	Only a couple of years old. It's so upsetting to think that she won't make it for much longer.
I hope you walked out right then and there!	Last night my date decided to keep checking out the hot girl at the table next to us.
ah that was really disrespectful of her though. That's not someone you'd want to date long term.	I didnt. I kept on with the date. She was very pretty and well dressed. She drove a nice care. I was kind of envious of it.
That is good to hear. She should be a big help a lot quicker than normal then.	The new girl at work is doing really well considering she has not experience. I'm shocked!
That should bode well for her and her future there though, so it was a good surprise!	I agree! Everyone including me were quite shocked byt it.
How has it been going?	After a year of being single I decided to start dating again.
That is good, hopefully you find your soulmate.	Its very boring since Im usally home by myself alot. NOw that Iim starting to date it wont be so boring.
Oh god. Did anything happen?	A tiger decided to act crazy at the zoo yesterday while the ring leader was doing a performance on stage!
Well, I hope nothing bad happened!	Everybody was screaming and leaving the place! It was very scary for everyone! I didnt stay to find out.
I watched it too! My favorite is Federer. Who is yours?	I watched Wimbledon for the first time. Those tennis players are so good!
I have for the past 10 years! It's one of my favorite sports to watch.	I like watching Serena Williams. Do you watch every summer?
That's great. Do you thiink you will get a raise?	My yearly review is coming up and I have been doing well this year.
Confidence is super important	I really think I will. I dont expect less than that. I have confidence in it.
good luck. even though you don't need it	I agree. I have no doubt it will go well.
That's great! You must be happy!	My boyfriend came home from his trip early. I wasn't expecting him home for another two days!
How come he came home early?	I was! It was very unexpected and exciting. Although, I was hoping to have time to clean the place up before he got home.
That's really thoughtful of you. Do you typically do things like that?	I took my neice to volunteer at a homeless shelter this past weekend. She showed alot of compassion and love for the homless and needy.
Perhaps I should find the local shelter in my community and do the same. I have never done that before and I feel like I should be giving back to those less fortunate in some capacity.	Well I volunteer to help abused and battered kids. I wanted to show her things like this. I know she can be a good loving person.
Yay! Do you guys have free time to spend together now?	My boyfriend came home from his trip two days early!
That sounds great, you should make him dinner to surprise him back!	Yes. I'm very excited since I haven't seen him in two weeks.
How long did that last for?	I was so upset today because 2 people decided to block traffic because of an argument.
Why didn't you tell them to move?	for a good 45 minutes. At that it was during rush hour. everybody was so mad at them.
You must really miss them.	A few years back I moved to a new state.  Now my childhood best friends and I live in different parts of the country and I don't know anyone really where I am.
Yea. Seeing each other on a screen definitely can't beat being with each other in person.	I really do.  I mean we're in constant contact over the internet through instant messaging and video calls.  But it's not often that we all can get together and see each other in person.
did he catch you doing something crazy?	My boyfriend unexpectedly came home from his trip two days early!
Thats good lol	No, thankfully I was just eating.
That's so sad. Do you have any other friends there?	My coworkers last day of work was today. Im so upset she is leaving.
I am so sorry for you. Perhaps you can hang with her after your workdays?	Yeah i do, but she was the one I was closest to. Yes I was very sad.
New York is a fun place to visit.	I cant wait for Friday! I go on vacation to New York!
You will have a blast.	I agree. I never been there so Im so happy!
Oh no! was it too short for your liking?	So my hair dressed ruined my hair! Im so mad!
Yikes! I would ask for a refund for sure	Actually I had to shave my head off. She used new product that burnt my hair!
Wow! Well a cheat day here and there might be okay! Haha	So I lost 20 lbs onmy diet and last night I ate a whole large pizza!
Right, but I'd say once isn't too bad as long you stay on track.	I agree. I feel bad for doing so!
I would feel terrible too. Where did you move to?	I remember when my friends were helping me move out of our hometown.  We were riding in the moving truck and it came time to drop them off and say goodbye.  We all felt terrible.
I've moved almost half a dozen times in my life before, so I completely understand. Those were rough times.	I moved to a town about 30-45 minutes away, but at that point we were so used to seeing each other every day of our lives.  It was hard to get used to.
That sucks, imagine being in an environment like that all day, I would go crazy	The manager the store was very mean and rude to the employees. I could not beleive it.
I guess some people are just really rude, no matter what position you put them in	I agree. It made me sick to my stomach seeing it. I feel bad for them!
It's hard to trust a GPS. I have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way. Please tell me you didn't do it.	Last night my GPS asked me to make a right down a dark and scary road.
I am so glad that it didn't turn out bad for you.	I was very nervous and doubting to do it. I actually did and it wasnt that bad
what did he do , how did he react ?	I finally told my friend I was into him. He didnt take it too well.
Well he is the one missing out and  i'm sure your very worthy of attention from some better.	He rejected me and told me not to every call him again. Im so embarrassed. I should have known better.
Why was she upset? Depending on how many people entered, fifth could be really good.	Last night my neice placed 5th at her dance performance. She was so upset and so was I
That's still really good! She did better than 25 other people.	There were 30 girls. We worked very hard and felt she would place top 3 but what an outcome it was to be 5th.
NIce! I bet you cant wait! Do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up?	I am very excited to not have any plans this weekend. It's going to be so nice to relax for two whole days.
Very nice! I bet its going to be a good happy weekend.	Just relaxing this weekend.
Dang, and here I thought I was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest. Maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big?	My best friend has won those Taco Bell Playstation 4 giveaways twice so far.  I wish I could be that lucky sometimes.
Why stop at 50? We ought to get 100! We need to show your friend and evil corporate Taco Bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!	I know, man just got together and buy like 50 boxes and cross our fingers.  And another thing was he got it on his first try both times.
Did you let him?	My nephew asked me to use my car this weekend for a drivers ed class.
You are good to allow him to borrow the car.	We have been practicing together in my car , so I feel I can let him.
Wow, I really like to do that. I hope you will enjoy it..	Im planning on going sky diving this weekend!
Ah ok. If you try once you will be alright next time..	I dont know. I hate heights, so im very nervous about it
That sounds revolting! Have you said anything to him about it?	My roommate leaves leftovers in the fridge and they get moldy.
That sounds like a good plan. Perhaps you should request a formal resume from any potential roommates for your future abode.	No. I'm not very confrontational. And our lease is up in two months anyway so I'm just going to wait it out.
Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?	I was at the library today and was trying to study, but this lady across the table was smacking her gum very loud.
That was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners.	well the library is very small so limited seats so I had to sit there and listen to it. I was so frusterated
That's so exciting! Have you run a marathon before?	So this weekend Im going to do a marathon. I have worked very hard to get myself ready for it
That's good, I hope you do well! How did you prepare?	I never have. I think all this time I been practicing will pay off.
What a nice surprise! Did something happen or did he miss you!?	My boyfriend came home from his trip two days early!
I see.I bet you and him are happy to be able to spend a little time together.	His business trip wrapped up a few days earlier than planned.
I'm sorry to hear. Why is that?	I doubt I will get any sleep waiting for tomorrow.
Oh, well that is a fine thing indeed! I would be  jumping up and down!	I am finally getting to take the kids to Disneyland!
Sounds pretty lonely. Did you meet or make some friends while out of town?	I had to go out of town by myself for three weeks. It was hard not being able to talk to anyone I knew.
Ah I see. Staying focused is hard, especially when your lonely.	No, I was too busy focusing on work while I was there.
That's horrible! Is she going to try again?	My neice didnt get into nursing school.She worked so hard for this. I feel bad for her.
It must have been awful to see that in someone you care about. I'm glad she's not giving up.	Yeah she is. She is going to retake some classes she made a B in. The look on her face after she found out was pricelss.
wow , thats great. You must be loving it	I cant wait for this weekend! Im leaving for New York!
You must get a good sleep now to enjoy the New york later	Yeah I cant wait. I never been, so I cant sleep thinking about it.
Nice! Were they scratch offs?	My coworkers and I got $200 dollars worth of lottery tickets.
I will cross mine too! I hope ya'll win it big.	For the powerball. We are all crossing our fingers!
OMG....that had to be so scary.	Last night while driving home I fell asleep at the wheel.
I am so glad that you are. Now no more driving when your sleepy.	Yes it was. My phone rang and thats what woke me up. Im so lucky to be here today.
That really sucks. Maybe you should try egging their door? Or just break in and pretend you're bigfoot while they're trying to sleep.	My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep.
I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!	I'm not trying to get arrested! I think I'll just wait things out until I move in two months.
That is some exciting news. Do you already know what kind of vehicle you want?	Im expecting a good bonus to be on this check coming up. I can finally go buy a new car!
Christmas is coming early. You will have to take me for a ride.	Yes! Very exciting! Yes I had my eye on one all year. I cant wait
I am sure you will. Good luck for you!!	I studied so hard and prepared for this exam tomorrow. I bet I will make no less than an A
Whats kind of exam is that?	Thanks! It will be a breeze.
Don't be. i think you will ace it.	I've got a big test coming up and I'm so worried!
exam's are always scary. we just need to take the mind out of it	I hope so. I usually do better than I expect to, but that still doesn't make it any less scary.
Why not block the calls?	My bank has called me three times a day ever since I applied for a mortgage. It's been a week and they show no signs of slowing down.
Have you asked them to stop calling about this topic?	I want them to be able to get in touch with me if something important comes up.
Have you spoken to him?	My upstairs neighbors make a ton of noise at all hours of the night. It makes it difficult for me to sleep.
Maybe you should buy some earplugs.	No, I don't like to be confrontational. I'm moving in two months anyway, so I'm just going to wait it out.
I love tennis. Will you watch the US Open?	I watched Wimbledon on TV over the summer for the first time. Those tennis players are so good!
It is a great tournament, you should watch.	Maybe. I hadn't considered it yet.
So are they telling you good news?	My bank has called me three times a day ever since I applied for a mortgage. It's been a week and they show no signs of slowing down.
Oh okay. Well hopefully they give you a chance to breathe and decide what you want to do.	Not yet. I just filled out the prequalification online. I haven't officially applied yet.
Ooh how nice! Do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you?	My mom said she was going to make me a mystery dinner. I believe in her!
Well I hope it's good! Your mom sounds like a great person to have a fun surprise for you like that.	Nope! She was going to make something completely different from what she usually makes!
You are so lucky to find someone special online. That can turn out so badly sometimes for some people.	I met my wife online 7 years ago and can't see myself with anyone else, ever.
That sounds like fate? Being that both of you lived close to each other.	Oh I know. I got lucky, we found out we lived really close to each other so we met up and it has been great ever since.
Wow, watching kids grow up is hard. How has she been with the cell phone?	My daughter has worked very hard to keep her school work finished, her room clean, and the dishes washed. I bought her a cell phone for her birthday this year. She is becoming a responsible young preteen
That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.	"She has been good so far. We are trying to limit her access to it to just a few hours per day. She also had to ""turn it in"" at night before she goes to bed."
I am sure with your guidance she will!	Yes, you do! Hopefully she keeps doing the right thing with it
You should go, Otherwise the condition could get worse.	I have been having some anxiety lately and made an appointment with a psychiatrist. I kept going back and forth about if I wanted to actually go
That is great news! fortunately doctors are there to help us and i'm glad they have helped you!	I ended up going. I'm really glad I did. She has been a HUGE help for me.
Oh my goodness that sounds so bad! Did they charge you for the visit?	I had a septic tank issue and called a guy that I found a business card from and had him come out. He didn't have hardly any equipment with him and sounded like he didn't know what to do.
You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.	No. I just asked what it would cost to fix then told him I couldn't afford it to get him to leave.
If I had a bag of M&M's right now I would eat them for sure!	I bought a big bag of M&Ms and I could not resist it
maybe save the other half for later. lol.	well that is what I just did, so far I have eaten half of it
That's ok, it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.	I do not think I can and feel ashamed that I cannot resist it
How did she reacted to the admission to self harm?	I told my girlfriend about my self harm habits a little while ago.
Now that your girlfriend knows the problem,  the both of you can work on solutions and support together.	She was really sad, but she appreciated the fact that I told her.
Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?	My friends wanted to bring me to laser quest for my birthday.
I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.	Yeah exactly. I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not and I was a little unwilling to try it out.
Oh that sounds worrisome, do you think you will pass?	I spent all of summer doing everything but studying for my final exam
I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly, if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.	I'm fairly certain I'm going to fail and I feel awful about myself, but I just can't get myself to do it.
That sounds intensive! How did it go?	My friends and I had spent all day troubleshooting a new PC build that we had just completed.
I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.	It went awful. It turned out that the motherboard or processor were defective and we had to deconstruct it to return both pieces. So much wasted time!
That's a good bright side to look at.	It really was. At least my friend learned a lot about computers as we built it together!
Did you save it or kill it?	I found an injured spider with a leg missing in my bathroom a few days ago.
It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.	I saved it. I brought it outside and hoped for the best.
ooh, I bet you can't wait to finish!	I passed two trials that a company put me through and I only have three left.
I hope you get it! Good luck!	You got that right! I'm feeling pretty happy about my performance and I think I'll get the job!
How did they go? Did you pass?	I spent hours studying for a final exam.
Wow! congrats, you should totally be proud of yourself.	It went amazing! I expected to pass but I didn't think I'd get a 91!
That's very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.	I found an old stamp booklet my girlfriend and I filled out before we started dating.
You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.	Definitely. I felt so warm and fuzzy on the inside, and so did she when I sent her a snapchat of it.
Did you get her number?	I'm pretty sure a girl at the convention was hitting on me.
Good man, I have a lot of respect for that.	Nah. I have a loving girlfriend and I would never cheat on her.
That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!	For my camping trip, I brought with me my tent, camping chairs, mattress, sleeping bag, pillows, med-kit, bug spray, food and beer.
Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!	Oh yeah definitely. Never have I ever felt so ready for anything in my life.
Holy cow! Did you call him in?	I saw a man slap his dog on the sidewalk a few times while I was on the bus.
Oh man!  Do you have a dog?	I should have, but last time my girlfriend did that the police ignored it. I was so angry.
How come? And was it a pain to replace it?	I just had to replace one of the window panes in my house.
I hope he did a good job!	I'm not sure what happened.  I had to have a guy come out to replace it, and couldn't meet him, so my wife had to.
Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.	My said he did!  I had quite a bit of confidence in him, based on others' feedback.
How come you didn't collect them? i loved them myself.	When I was a kid, all my friends had Yu-Gi-Oh cards but me.
Well, they are expensive and you didn't really miss much.	I think my parents found them expensive, otherwise I can't think of any other good reason. To be honest, I kind of envied my friends.
Nice, Was it hard to start?	I took up running and I started seeing a huge improvement in my cardiovascular endurance.
Wish i could run close to 5km, i'd struggle with 100 meters.	Unimaginably hard. But once I got into it I couldn't stop. I'm feeling pretty certain that I'll hit my 5km goal in no time.
That's cool. Man, those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?	My younger brother was playing an old Gamecube game that I loved to play back when I was a kid.
That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well.	He was playing Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door. What an awesome game! It brought back so many great memories.
That sounds horrible, Did you wash it or throw it away?	My buddy drank way too much at a party and puked all over my favorite jacket.
That is a really rough story, You should make him pay for another one.	I washed it and it came out surprisingly. But at that time, I felt so sick seeing what was happening to my jacket that I thought I was going to puke next.
damn, is he ok now?	A few months ago, a good friend of mine that I look up to attempted suicide.
Did he go to the doctors for help? anyway i'm glad he is OK.	Thankfully he is. He's doing much better, but the thought still shakes me scared to this day.
Oh no! Was it a fun night?	I drank too much and passed out a few months ago.
Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though!	It was, but it got scary at some point. Apparently people were trying to wake me up by shaking me and I would not get up.
Aww, that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?	I was packing up my house to move, and found my old yearbooks! It's so weird to look back and see how far everyone I knew in high school has come.
I get that.  It's weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.	A couple people. Fewer as the years go by, unfortunately.
Poor thing!  Is he felling better now?  I hope he quit that diet.	My brother went on a low-calorie diet and began shaking everyday.
Thank god he is ok.  There are very dangerous diets around, better be guided by his doctor.	He quit the diet a while ago as recommended by his doctor. I was a little scared but I knew it was just side effects of a bad diet.
Were you nervous?	I let my brother drive my car for the first time yesterday.
That's awesome.  I'm glad he did so well.	No, he's such a good driver. I knew I had nothing to worry about.
That's lovely! I love waking up to awesome texts.	Last week I woke up to a really cute text from my girlfriend and a funny message from my brother.
That's so wonderful to hear.	Yeah! I had a moment of realizing how lucky I am to be in the position I find myself in, and felt really thankful for my life and the people a part of it.
How did that make you feel?	My girlfriend spent a few days in the woods with no cellular service with her parents.
I bet. I'm not great at being away from my boyfriend.	Really lonesome. I missed her so much.
That's great! What have you been doing to socialize?	Ever since I've been on these anti anxiety and depression medication, I've been able to socialize a lot more.
What kind of convention?	Just talking to more people in general. For example, at a convention I was volunteering at.
That's such a sweet thing to do.	I volunteer at a dog shelter every weekend.
Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.	Thank you, they're so cute!
Lil Peep died? when.	I'm still upset over Lil Peep's death.
damn, him and XXXtentacion we're really good.	November of 2017. Almost a year ago.
I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair.	My dog sheds so much I have to vacuum my room practically every 4 days if I don't want little tufts of fur everywhere.
I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog	You're right. I'm just so irritated, even if it isn't his fault and I love the big goof.
Oh my, that sounds like an absolute blast!	My brother and a bunch of our friends planned to go to a 15-person cottage in July.
Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation.	It was. At that time, I couldn't wait for all the fun and games we would experience!
What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?	We stayed for only 4 days because it cost us about $200 each for four days and nights, but I hope we can book it for a whole week or two next summer.
Sounds like heaven!	It's very close to a lake, it probably takes a two minute hike down through a patch of trees and tall grass to get there.
Oh no! Did you get in trouble?	One time when I was in Kindergarten, I needed to go to the restroom. The teacher did not let me, so I peed myself
Aww, I'm sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson	Yes, they called my parents and I was sent home. I got spanked
It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?	Last month I went on vacation and had to find someone to cat sit. It was a relief to find someone that I could trust to come by each day and not forget.
Aw, that was so nice! I'd love to find a cat sitter like that!	Yes, I was able to go visit my stepdaughter on the other side of the country. The sitter sent pictures occasionally, so I didn't spend my trip worrying.
How did it go? What'd you get him for a gift?	My son had his 4th birthday a couple of weeks ago.
It seems like all those years just flew by, huh. At least now he's getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!	He got a remote control excavator, and had a lot of fun at his party.  It's crazy how fast he's growing up, though.
Are you feeling zapped from the week?	It's really hard to get motivated on Fridays.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to work through the weekend!	Yeah, there's a lot going on.  I ended up heading to work anyway.
It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though, it's all you got sometimes!	No, I don't have to.  But there's plenty of work to do on our house!
I feel that pain. Do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do?	I bought a bunch of dumbbells, and a workout bench but I've barely used them.
I get that. Well if I could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything. Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage.	I don't have the motivation. I know the workouts I should be doing but also struggle with proper form a bit.
Sure. I love working out.	Thanks for the advice!
How much pain are you on a scale of 1-10?	i have a impacted wisdom tooth. I need to go to the dentist but I am apprehensive about it.
Dang that sounds bad! I know you might be frightened of going but I think you should go. You'll be better off for it.	on bad days it is about a 6
That was nice of them! I bet you felt really cool hanging with them. How did it go?	A few years ago, I was invited to Rockfest by my older brother and his friends.
That is awesome! I love festivals, they're always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people.	Yeah it was awesome! I was a little scared at first but within a few hours of arriving there it turned into a total blast!
Why not, have you have many temptations?  I know how difficult it can be at times to eat healthy, I struggle to do it too.	I haven't been following my healthy eating regiment as strictly as I should.,5|5|5_5|5|5,
I know, fresh bread is a big temptation to me, and what about sweets and desserts, do you have a weakness for those too?	Yeah. Carbs like pasta and bread get me every time.
It's really a good start to recognized that you should talk about it. We all need someone to just listen once in awhile.	I told my best friends about my suicidal thoughts.
Oh that's a good friend. I hope your feeling better now.	Yeah you're right. I had faith in them and they ended up being really supportive.
I like dominos better	One time I thought about getting Dominoes Pizza, but then I remembered I was loyal to Pizza Hut
Dominoes, IMO, has better prices and better pizza. I dont like all that oil	It tastes pretty good now, but I still like the oily goodness of Pizza Hut!
That's thoughtful of her. Nice to know that your mom was thinking of you in the middle of the day.	One time my mom brought me lunch all the way from the restaurant where she works!
Take her out to dinner! That would be a treat.	Yup, she is the best! I shall make it up to her one day!
Oh no! You must've felt ashamed. did you return it?	One time I was at the grocery store and I accidentally walked out with a item without paying for it
Hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?	Yes, I got caught and had to walk back in shame!
Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their.	I was very late to work today and they were so busy with patients.
Its always best to be on time , I hope they understand no one is perfect.	Well I will find out tomorrow. I know better than that is what she told me, especially on Fridays, when we are the busiest.
The journey there is always the toughest, its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it	My boss told me to go to school to become a doctor instead of a nurse. I felt like it was a compliment. Im worried about how much and how long medical school will take.
With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time	I agree. I guess I will weigh my options, its just im getting old and watn to start a family too, so I dont know.
Wow,  that was serious then	My friend and I got in an argument about religion today. It made me question my faith.
OK,  so what is your plan now?	Yeah. I want to stay true to my beliefs, but she made some very valid points.
Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?	I remember back when I started college. I moved to a new state where I didn't know anyone and I had no idea what to expect.
Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people	Yes, I did eventually. There's something to be said for living in a dorm at a time when you want to meet new people and fit in.
Oh, that must have been a hard thing to do. I'd hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news...	Today I had to tell a patient about her lab results. Come to find out she could not have babies. She was very upset.
So sad...that makes me want to cry, too, just hearing about her reaction.	Yeah I felt bad. She started crying so much. Its like her world ended there.
I bet it does! Do you go by there often?	Whenever I go back to my hometown I love driving by the house I grew up in. I have such great memories.
I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.	I get to visit about once a year. I always wish that I knew who lived there now so I could see the inside of the house.
Oh no :( Can you tell me? It's okay if it's too private.	I found out some bad news the other day.
Oh my gosh I'm so sorry that really sucks. :( Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?	I just got back my grade for my final for my class and I failed it. I studied real hard, but unfortunately it didn't seem to matter.
Good luck to you! I wish you all the best <3	I'm going to have to at least try. Maybe they'll be understanding and let me attempt again.
Oh no why would they do such a thing	Someone twisted what I Said earlier today to make it seem like i was saying something else. I felt reall ybad.
Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.	They were angry and wanted to be aggressive.
That's not cool. I bet it felt awkward.	Some lady I know tried to hit on me even though she very well knew I am in a relationship!
You are a stand up person!	It really did but I would never do something to jeopardize my relationship.
Nice, silence is golden	I had a nice quiet evening at home tonight.
Full of what?	Well, my family was here, too.  Toddlers don't make life quiet, but they make me feel fulfilled.
Oh no, was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?	There was a meeting scheduled today that I thought was utterly pointless.
Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling.	It definitely was, so I ended up skipping it.
Oh really, were you supposed to tell them?	I told my close friend a very big secret yesterday.
You can never be to sure now a days, they might post your secret to social media.	It was my choice. I really don't think they'll tell anyone! They're good people.
Did you ace your test?	One time I was really sure that I was going to ace a test because I studied all night
I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately, I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!	Yup, I was worried during the test too, but I am glad everything turned out okay
Nice, what a legend and a gentleman	A friend at work recently got a raise.  That's the 2nd one in the last year for him!
Word, you should ask him what the secret is	Yeah, but I haven't had one in 3 years.
That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me, the guilt would destroy me.	I was totally committed to him in every way I could be.   HOwever he ended up cheating on me
Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.	It would me too, not only that but he just up and got with her like I never existed to him.   Its funny because he always accused me of cheating on him and I had no clue why.  It was him the whole time!
It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...	He kept doing drugs, and taking things that didnt belong to him.  It broke my heart but I didnt know what else to do.
You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.	Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk.
Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?	today after coming back from work i saw my wife and she was asking me why are you late with questioning eyes, i told her that i wen't to go and get her favourite meal, i felt so faithful
It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.	she was joking about it, but she was so happy afterwards and we ate together, it was such a nice day
That's inspiring, has that worked for you in the past in the same way?	after a long day from work, i was stuck at this math problem, but then i decided to go for a walk instead of working on the problem, i trust my guts, after i had come back from the walk, the solution kicked in and i was able to do the problem
That's so cool, you seem very intuitive	yes always, it is something that works for me
That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?	it was 3am, i was walking at the utter night... i was scared out of my mind... anything could happen, my walking speed increased... and everything i was seeing suddenly became more and more scary
Why were you walking so late at night?	in the end yes.. but the journey was sure hell
Nice, what are some things you realized?	today i realised the small details of my life and i feel more satisfied
You don't have me yet <3	that i have everything i wished for.
oh god, how did you . have the courage to even go outside?	One time I bought water and snacks before a hurricane came to wreck my city
that sounds like an adventurous day	My house flooded so I had to get on my roof !
Wow, how could they do that?	One time they put cheese in my hamburger when I told them not to!
Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!	They are complete monsters I tell ya!
You should. No matter what you can't lie to your Mom. It will always come back on you.	i lied to my mother and i feel very uneasy
Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.	i just realised this now
Nice! Do you have any superpowers?	i am beginning to realise in my abilities and i feel so confident in them, i am able to anything
I like your confidence! Fighting!	In a way yes,yes i do the power of my will and mind
oh nice, what kind of memories?	When I drink coffee, memories from my past keep playing in my head
how does this make you feel like?	Memories of talking to strangers in chatroom. Lots of things
That's awesome! You're going to be rolling in the dough with those skills	I have been working on my programming skills and I feel like I can get a new job now!
That's exciting. How long have you been learning programming?	Hell yeah, no more living in mom's basement!
an interesting one, what does this make you feel ?	From time to time I see an older man around our town driving his lawn mower from place to place..  SOmetimes I see him at  McDonalds,or the Dollar General Store.
oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?	Well at first I thought it was cute until I saw him at the gas station the other day.  I overheard him asking someone that was getting gas if he happened to have a little change he could have.  He needed to get home in his lawnmower but didn't have the money to do so.   I ended up giving him 3 bucks.
That is so kind of you, I also a have a soft heart for animals.  I happen to be a dog person, but I do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.	i believe i am a really caring person, because i always take care of cats and feed them and lately they are more and more close to me
I can't say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .	i am a both person ahaha i also have a dog, but he is always so mean
where are you going!	towels, clothes, underwear and phone all checked! and ready for my holiday #feelingsoprepeared
thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her	TO SEE MY BABY GIRL
Wow, that must've been disappointing.	One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and I didn't win anything!
Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.	Yes, I was off by one number. I was going to be a millionaire!
Yeah, it's like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same	every day the weather makes me feel so nostalgic, the colors, the wind all bring back a certain memory from my past
Yup, and I feel there's a part of us that is eternal as well	yes! i am so glad you get it, it's beautiful but also sad at the same time
I think I would leave if I saw something like that.	One time I went into the public restroom and saw poop smeared everywhere! Ew!
Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?	I left as fast as possible!
It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.	Nope, just you!
I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account, how's school going?	One time I was so nervous to look at my grade for my final exam
Word, college is tough, wishing you the best	I failed and dropped out! Now I live in my parents house doing nothing all day
and got upset with you?	like who on earth writes var int value = 1, this is so ridiculous i am so annoyed at my brother, after everything i tought him, he doesn't even know the basics
And why do not you try to teach your brother?	no i was the one who was upset with him
Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out, though.	i am working so hard, that i can see a pile of money building up for my future
That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.	it doesn't i am taking regular breaks
Dang, how fast did you run away?	One time I saw a creepy person run towards me in the night out in the streets
Did you tell him how creepy he is lol	I froze up because I was terrified. It was just my brother though
That is awesome, what types of photos did you find? Anything funny or silly?	While I was packing my stuff to move, I found Old high school pictures. It made me think of all the good times  I had.
Aww yeah, those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years!	Well more of my old best friend. I have not seen her i a long time.We went through alot together. It was nostalgic to me.
It's not fair, eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same?	being alive is so much stress and anxiety, why does it have to be like this? why can't we just all express our individual selves, instead we are forced to work so that we can eat
Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another.	Yes, it's true we all know this inside out, but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives, the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting, if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life, not one which just gives the impression of freedom, that's all there is now, faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings
Oh wow, what ovie was it and how did it make you feel?	I watched a movie the other night that really got me in my feelings.
oh wow that sounds very emotional, I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears.	I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart.
I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me	i am so disappointed in myself, i could have do so much better at work but i guess it wasn't my day, i was not able to focus
May be you are right. But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.	what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy's law
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up?	My grandma ended up getting really sick this last week.
That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :)	She is getting much better. My family and I did everything we could to take care of her.
Oh no, maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!	i feel so guilty, my sister crying because 'someone eat her cake' that she had been saving for 2 days now, and that someone was non other than me...
Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too, I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :)	oh wow you are such a genius! why didn't i think of that before... there is always a bright side to everything
I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?	words cannot describe how happy i am, in 2 weeks time i will go and see my wife i am so joyful and exciting
Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon	no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her, but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart
Oh no what happened, are you alright?	I had a terrible experience at the grocery store today.
Oh no that must have been a terrible experience, I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.	Yeah, I'm alright. But I dropped a jar of pasta sauce and it ended up shattering. Sauce got all over the floor.
That's what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?	I aced all my classes this semester, so Im hoping and thinking my GPA will be a 4.0
wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.	I actually gave more effort this semester, so I will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year.
It sounds like you're quite the organized person!	So everything for a party im throwing this weekend is ready and everything is paid for. I have it ready last week so I wouldnt stress.
I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.	Yea. I like to have things ready and done prior to make sure everything goes well.
That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :)	Im going to ask my girlfriend to marry me this weekend! I have no doubt in my mind she will say no
That is great, I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you!	Thanks! I think we are doing well so i wont be disappointed or sidetracked by a no from her.
I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters, if we make a difference or not, we all end up dust in the end.	i am so afraid... afraid that i am not giving too much to the world, what if i parish not having done anything?
If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.	no, i don't believe that, whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage, just like birth death is a process
Yeah, 70s were incredible, the dancing the cars, the women had style and the music was incredible.	the world is such a disgusting place now, i wish i was born back in the 70s
But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.	RIGHT?! but now is just so bad, i wish i could go back
Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.	today everyone said congratulations to me, as i succeed in making an amazing app, and now i am so greatful to be alive!
There will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.	thank you! it's always nice to tell you these things, you don't get jealous and you are just happy for me, thank you
Oh no, can you return it or get a refund?	I came home from work today to a disaster. My dog chewed up the new couch i just purchased.
I am sorry to hear that, I would have felt the same way.	No I didnt purchase insurance. When i saw it my blood was boiling!
That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.	I gave my dog away to a family today. I did not have time for him since work and school take alot of it up.
I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!	I agree, but im praying they will take care of him. hes just a puppy.
OH no! Are you the jealous type?	I saw my girlfriend getting real friendly with another guy at the bar last night
OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!	It definitely had me feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation.
oh no do you feel ready for it?	I have a test coming up next week.
That is great, I believe that you will do amazing!	I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.
Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?	I AM SO ANNOYED! i have been trying to solve this math problem for 2 hours now
Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.	there isn't any solution it's a century award i am working on, it's the problem of non-polynomial descent
That is great, what has been going on in your life recently?	I'm really feeling alright about how my life is going right now.
That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :)	I've just been getting things done. Nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either.
They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?	The ads for the new World Of Warcraft expansion really makes me think about when I played it many years ago.
If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.	It does. I put so much time in that game before. I might have to pick it up again.
That is always frustrating. What happened?	I woke up to something super annoying this morning.
Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.	I woke up to find out my car was sideswiped while it was parked by the curb during the night. No note or anything.
What did he do?	I'm really disappointed in my son's actions that I was told about.
Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?	He got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day.
What was it that you accidentally ate?	I ate such a disgusting thing the other day by accident.
Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?	I bought a sandwich and after a few bite I noticed that there was a bunch of mold.
I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.	I recently had my first child.  I was absolutely terrified when I went into labour but I put all my faith in the wonderful midwives and everything worked out perfectly!
You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody, I agree.	it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career, its not just a job but a vocation.
I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?	I started a diet today and just as soon as I get home I eat a burger!
Don't be too hard on yourself, it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying, I believe in you!	Fried foods. I feel bad I didn't commit to it the first day.
I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!	Thank you! I need that motivation so I can get over this shame im feeling.
Why not? What happens tomorrow?	I'm so not looking forward to tomorrow.
Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!	I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow.
That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!	I changed my shift to overnight and walking to my care gave me the creeps tonight. There was a man standing in the dark.
I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!	I agree. I had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine.
I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!	My brother is going into surgery tomorrow.
I am sure the procedure will go excellently.	I'm really hoping so! I've been really worried.
That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!	Today my friend had all of is awe, becasue she won the singing contest at work. She is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing.
That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.	I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.
He's a brave man. How was the experience?	I have such a fear of flying, so you can just imagine how I felt when my husband bought us a sky diving voucher for my 30th birthday! He was so excited and I was so nervous and uneasy.
It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!	Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.  Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time, i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out, it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!
Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!	I was so worried that I could not pay for my tuition this semester. Thankfully my boss decided to give us a big bonus.
You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.	Yeah and its the last one before I graduate! I can be more thankful for his generosity.
Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?	I was doing a big clear out recently and stumbled accross my old high school year book.  It is a long time since I left school and couldnt believe I even still had it.  Such a feeling of nostalgia looking at the old photos and reading the stories.
It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.	Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those, especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.
That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.	So i just bought a brand new corvette and I let my friend barrow it to go out of town.
I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.	I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol
Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.	My husband wont be back for a month due to work and Im here at the house by myself.
Do you get nervous being on your own?	Yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house.
Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.	Nah just bored. Im new to this city so I dont know anybody either.
Im sure your not though!	Yea I agree! II feel so helpless being home by myself.
Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?	I had the worst experience last weekend.  I woke up to find someone had stolen my car! I was in absolute shock just couldnt believe it.
Yeah i would have felt the same way.	Well yes.  While i was in my daze, absolutely horrified, my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.
yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.	Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!
That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon	Today after a long day at work I sat in traffic for 2 hours due to construction on the freeway!
That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.	Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks.
How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.	My old friend suprised me with a phone call today. I have not heard from her since high school.
That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.	Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!
Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?	A little stray pup appeared on my driveway yesterday.  My initial reaction was to contact the local pet shelter.  However no one had reported him.  I decided to take him in, wash him and feed him.  I have never been much of an animal person but I couldnt believe how much i felt for this poor wee puppy.
The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness!	I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him, even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward, I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!
Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.	I got super wasted. I accidentally messed myself in front of people
That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!	Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink
What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.	I'm really excited for this next weekend!
That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!	A friend that has been living overseas for the last year or so is going to come back to visit finally!
That's interesting. Are you okay?	I had a really scary experience the other day.
That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.	Yeah, I'm fine. My friend got into a car crash while I was in the car though.
Why what happened?	I went camping the other day and had a rlly bad experience during it.
Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.	I ended up getting lost for a bit in the woods which was not fun. Luckily, I made it back to my group at some point.
Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.	When I was a teenager I used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge.  One time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages.  That weekend I borrowed it and of course ripped it!  The next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible.
That's probably a good idea.	oh yes she has, it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!
I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?	My last day of work was yesterday. I got so emotional driving home and I cried.
Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.	Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone.
hmmn, really?..i guess you must have felt very bad	Yesterday I found my boyfriend with someone else!
am so sorry about that, did he apologize?	I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.
Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?	One time when I was younger I wore a Halloween costume that I'd been looking forward to show off.  But I ended up covering myself up with a cape, because I was self conscious of how I looked.
It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself.	Well the costume itself ended up looking great, since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it, so I felt bad.
Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.	That's true, but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.
In reference to what?	Whom do you belive the most
My husband is my most trusted companion.	Your trustful person?
That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?	my father couldn't stope any lower, how can someone take money from their own child
How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.	i did many times, but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything
That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends.	my wife is always there for me, so i trust her more than anybody and i dont want to have any friends otehr than her, she is my faith
Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.	that's only normie talk, we are both introverted and we hate people
what did you do???	i am a joke, i am ashemed of what i did
well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers	i builied someone because they made fun of my mother, but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can't believe i did that
stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later	I  waited 3 years for them to realise season 3 and they promised it was to be released today, i was so devastated when i found out that they had to postpone it even more :/ it's just so annoying
it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.	i hope so :<
That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories.	I still have a favorite stuffed animal of mine that I've had since I was young.  It's still in pretty good condition and reminds me a lot of my childhood.
That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that.	Yeah, it is.  I always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it's even more special.
....what feelings? what are you talking about	a young girl, crying, sadden by the cruelity of our elders, told me about all these feelings i began to cry and became very sentimental
oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?	she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset
That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with	i am so envious of my sister, she has everything i just want to make her life hell
Other people deserve to have things, too.	yeah but only i should get everything! no one else
"Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, ""Safe!"""	i am so embaressed at myself... i cant believe i fell down the stairs and my pants fell and my behind was exposed to the whole crowd
Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it.	indeed, but this time i was red and yelling in my head
eh not really. what about you	don't you think life is peaceful? are you content?
and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?	i did, espcially today when i woke up, i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can't just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that, so i decided to work hard on becoming free
i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors	i will work on the things i enjoy, which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often
Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?	I've known my best friend since I was 4 years old.  He joined the Air Force after high school and moved out of state and I was really upset when he left.
I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least.	Oh yeah, we still keep in contact over the Internet daily and visit each other every few years.  But I miss when we used to hang out every day.
Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax.	the future is so uncertain and yet so certain i am so not ready for what's about to come it fills mee with anxiety and depression just thinking about it
If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on.	i hope so
that is great.. may i know what you have learnt	I have been spending a year learning a new skill and after so much study and hard work it is finally paying off. I am feeling faithful again.
it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it	I have been learning to trade on the Forex markets.
great day to you too	Thank you sir, have a great day!
How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!	i am so prepared the exam tomorrow!
You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.	yup but i have been studying since for a year
I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?	tomorrow i have interview and i have done my study so i am feeling confident
That's a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!	art design
Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.	I did so well in that biology exam haha, i anticipated those questions to come up i was so ready
Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.	yup! defiently, i am so amazing
Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?	i am so mad at myself, i woke up late again today and missed a very important deadline, even though i set 4 alarms
Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.	no, i can't i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem
Why do you need to go to the doctor?	I really hate going to the doctor. I was hesitant about going this time.
Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?	I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.
That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?	I was planning on going to grad school and I told a lot of people. I ended up not going, and I felt embarrassed every time someone asked me about how school was going.
Right.	Yes. Without really giving details, I always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn't work out.
Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?	I found a picture of my daughter and me from when I took her to a waterfall a long time ago. It brought tears to my eyes.
One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.	Yes she does. Of course she doesn't see the sentimentality of it yet as I do. She is only 23.
I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?	I have the worst fear of carnival rides, i always think they
Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.	(pressed enter too early). I love thrill rides, but i don't trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up, too many horror stories. I mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions.
Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?	My wife's cousin was sent to the hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma with something having to do with his lungs
I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?	Yes. They aren't sure what's wrong but his oxygen level is down to 40%
That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition	I was on the highway during a strong thunderstorm, no visibility. I had a bad feeling someone bad was going to happen and no more than 10 minutes later two cars in front of me crash and one gets flipped over.
I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.	Yeah I honestly don't but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen. A lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason.
It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.	Walking to a restaurant the other day and I forgot to hold the door open for an old lady, felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too.
It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!	I hope so, i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her.
Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?	I bought a new phone recently and not long after i dropped it and shattered the screen, first time this happens and it was just terrible.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.	No I usually don't since i've never dropped mines but I do get warranty now. It wasn't a cheap repair either.
Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school.	I was disgusted when my dog tried to attack another dog
Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.	Not really, but he knows better. I think I will get a trainer.
Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.	Saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away, felt nice seeing her on video again.
I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.	Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored.
That's awesome!  Congratulations!	I got the scores for my final exam. got a B and passed the class, it was a good day to celebrate.
Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate	Yeah, i pampered myself and went with some friends to a Japanese sushi place.
That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones	Ordered a new pair of headphones online. They are a really high end pair so I'm very excited to finally get them.
I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!	Yeah, it really is a day and night difference. Let's you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better.
Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?	My wife is having a hard time after finding out we can no longer have children. I am doing my best to support her and care for her but it is very hard when nothing seems to work.
I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.	I do but she doesn't. Which makes it harder I think. All I can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal.
Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest.	Back in middle school i had a crush on a girl and one day in class she was talking to another guy. I was jealous for a while but it didn't matter anyways. I ended up getting her.
I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.	It is, those were the funnest days. No responsibilities.
It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone	I had a lot of feelings when I found pictures of my dog who has passed.
You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!	It was very bittersweet. She could not work her legs anymore due to age.
Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?	I moved to my current town one year ago and I really like it here. I'm happy and couldn't think of a better place to live.
That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.	It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.
That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.	I very much could count on my mom to always be there for me.
Is there anything she does specifically for her?	Me too. I am so thankful for her.
I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?	I was upset when I failed my math test
Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.	I did, but the material was a hard subject.
That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?	I'm glad I can trust my husband to always be there for me.
That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.	Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@
Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?	Hi friend! Wow, I was so scared of this taxi driver when I was vacationing in Mexico. He looked rather suspicious.
Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol	No, I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case.
I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.	I was storing all of my old photos on my new external hard drive yesterday. It made me wish I could go back and time and see some relatives again.
I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.	It's bittersweet! Nice to see their faces again, but sad to miss them.
Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings	I lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn't
Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!	I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it.
That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too.	Sometimes a fly gets in my apartment and I hold my cat over my head and we chase it. She hasn't scratched or bitten me once while we do this!
Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.	I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!
That was thoughtful, sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!	I babysat my nephew overnight last weekend. He was scared so I let him sleep in bed with me, even though he kicks a lot.
Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.	Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool, but he's still very much a little kid.
My mistake :)	I'm an auntie :p
I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!	my pet dog is always there for me. No matter what, I can count on her.
I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!	yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you
Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.	I had a great breakfast this morning. It was delicious and I felt very happy and relaxed.
Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs...	Eggs, bacon, strawberries, tomatoes, and coffee. So yummy!
I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.	I called someone by the wrong name earlier today. I didn't really know them and hadn't seen them in ages.
I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.	They were ok with it, but I hope I didn't hurt their feelings.
What happened? The yard always has mysteries!	The other day we were in the front yard, and you won't believe what happened!
Shocking! Has your kid done that before?	My 4 year-old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!
Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.	I got into an argument with my husband and I realized later that he was right but I never apologized. :(
You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead.	Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way.
Your welcome! Glad I could help!	That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :)
I can understand the feeling, I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.	I'm unemployed and struggling right now. I feel really bad when people talk to me about their new stuff, even though they're not trying to be mean
You'll return to self-sufficiency soon, you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.	yeah! I just want to be able to support myself and not go to the food bank or rely on friends and family
Aww, that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.	I am so sad. My 3 dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries. Crying....
That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves	It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals.
Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example, is it quite tough?	One of my love birds had a baby but she is a terrible mother. So I am now taking care of the baby and feeding her everyday. She is so cute!
Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?	No. The baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy.
Keep up the good work!	Yes! I think so, haha!
I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.	I feel very happy that I moved out in the country. I thought I was a city person but I guess not.
All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.	Oh yes. It was hard to get used to at first but now I barely notice it.
Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.	Yes I think so. I especially enjoy this night owl that hoo's everynight.
Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.	Sure does. Your welcome to visit any time my friend.
Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?	I really wanted to go on this fruitarian trip to Bali butI could not get off work. My friends went without me
Yeah you might want to look into it then	No. My boss is not a very nice person. I think I should find a new job.
Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?	My dog is feeling sick and I don't know what is wrong.
Yes, google has a lot of great information for pet care.	I hate the vets. They charge so much money. Maybe I can google seomthing.
Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!	I am learning how to do day trading and did my first trade and I won
I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.	You think? It sure is exciting, at least when I win.
I wish you the very best with it all!	Your right. Let's see how I do next week.
You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard, they don't always turn the way you might hope!	Thanks my friend!
I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.	My dogs keep attacking my poor ducks. I don't know what to do
Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.	I scream at the dogs and it seems to be working but I never know what can happen in the future.
That would be bad you should double check before you leave	I packing to go on an international trip. I hope I don't forget anything.
Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry	I feel I can't fit anything else in my suitcase so I think I have it all. But I will double check like you said. :)
Why were you ashamed? Did she disturb the neighbors or something?	I was ashamed when my dog started barking loudly when I was away.
I'm sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training,	Yes, my neighbors were very angry.
Thats awesome! do yall have any plans?	I am exciting that my father said he would come and visit me soon. He travels so much and it is hard to get his time
lol maybe yall could find something to bond over	We are just going to hang out on the farm and hang out with the cows, ha ha
Yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone	Oh how I miss my days when I was in my twenties. Those were such fun times. To be young and free!
Yeah we all do but we can only go forward	It is so true. We take it for granted. I wish I knew then what I know now.
Have you taken her to the vet?	My cockatiel is feeling sick. I think she might die soon. I wish there was something I could do.
You might want to look up what is going on online	No. There are no vets where I live. I gave her some medicine though but nothing seems to be working.
That sucks. Next time they should tell you instead of laughing!	yesterday i notice people were laughing behind me, when I finally got to my desk, a coworker pointed out that a postage stamp was stuck to the back of my head
I'm sure it's not so bad. At least you can laugh about it now!	well looking back its funny, but man, yesterday i wished i could hide, plus I think my boss seen it too
That is great! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment	i am up for a promotion at my job. I positive I will get it.
that is good! I hope you enjoy yourself	I already have plans to go out to a nice restaurant and celebrate with my family
Awesome! What's it about?	i have a big presentation at my job at the end of this week. I am ready for it
Congrats! I hope it goes well. Are you presenting to a board of directors?	its about how some customers are not choosing our slow moving products. i have been working on it for weeks. i got it nailed down
Maybe you can save more and be able to get one.	a neighbor  just bought a brand new Lexus,  why can't I get one
Man that gets to me when someone does that , like they are better than everyone else.	its not just that, this neighbor is always buying expensive things and likes to show them off
The holidays are a great time for that sort of thing. What did your family do together?	i really miss the holidays when our family got together
I understand what you mean.  I hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other's company soon.	just the normal stuff,  but the kids are all grown up.Holidays are never the same without having kids around to enjoy it
I hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?	There is a job promotion coming up. I really do wish i can get it
well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!	i have interview for it and thinking i might get it but you never know
I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully something better is coming along for you soon.	i thought I was going to get a promotion. I found out I did not get it
Keep working hard and I think your efforts will eventually be noticed.	thank you, i was really depending on this promotion
Ah that always sucks, did she need to go out or is she sick or something?	my pet dog pooped all over my rug last week. She never did that before
Well it isn't as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.	i don't know, she never did that before, i don't know if the crap or her behavior got to me more
Oh no, is it painful and disrupting you in anyway?	ugh, I have a cavity and I do not want to go to the dentist
Yeah, I know what you mean it does sound very scary, but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out, they fill in the cavity!	its painful but the thought of it being pulled kind of freaks me out plus the cost of it.
What did you do?	We didn't really have anything planned this last weekend, so were thinking we'd be productive.
It has been raining a lot here too. Definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house.	Well, plans got changed.  It rained like crazy, so we couldn't work outside.
That's good, sometimes it's good to just be lazy inside the house.	It was okay, though. We got to spend some time hanging out and had a low-key weekend.
so are you making him a gift?	I still haven't been able to finish my dad's Father's Day gift.
don't worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it	Yeah, we're rebuilding a porch swing for him.  But I've had to hunt down some tooling.
Do you have a general fear of flying, or is there something about this trip?	i have to fly out of town next week. I do not know if I can, I have cold sweats thinking about it
Have you always had a fear of flying?  I haven't ever really feared it, but I don't like it.	it s the fear of flying, just the thought of it frightens me
Was it another boring day today?	Man, I really thought today could be a crazy day.
Ohh okay I see, yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too.	Well, it sort of turned out that way.  There was a big event at work today, and I wasn't sure how it would go.
I know the feeling. Hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day	over the weekend i  fell off my diet by eating a big bag of peanut M&Ms
Did you hide the wrappers?	you know the worst part of it, is that i hid it from my partner who is proud of me dieting, i feel bad for it
There's very few brands I feel that strongly about. What kind of yogurt is it, I might want to try it?	I always buy the same brand of yogurt and don't even bother trying other kinds. It's just so delicious and such a good price that I'm a loyal customer for life
I don't think I have ever seen that kind in the store, I'll have to look for it next time I go. I don't care much for the runny yogurt, but I like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet.	Astro balkan plain! It's not as pastey as greek yogurt, or runny like other kinds
That is horrible. Americas government wont be of help....hopefully you have family?	I lost my job because I got diagnosed with a chronic disease. It's a real double whammy - loss of income and an incurable disease. I'm still angry and upset, three months later.
No cat or dog?	No I'm all by myself
Yes I love animals and have 3 dogs right now.	Have you ever had a strong attachment and love for an animal?   I have had several.
I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.	Well then you will understand the love I had for my pitbull named Lily.   We had a special bond and when she died it broke my heart.  Never leave a candle burning and leave the house.   OUr house burned and she died of smoke inhalation.  I will never forget her!
That sounds super scary, could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?	Once during a snowstorm I had to go to the airport. My taxi driver decided that driving on the highway in the middle of nowhere late at night was the perfect time to tell me all about how he would kill a man
Oh wow, it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation.	I shrank into myself and prayed for the car to go faster and not crash
That sounds a little scary. Why was he running towards your car?	One time there was a homeless guy running towards my car
Did you give him any?	He wanted money!
Aww, I am sorry, but I must say Pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good, did they help you feel any better?	I'm really stressed today so I bought a box of Pirate peanut butter cookies and ate an entire sleeve of them. I feel pretty bad because I wrecked my dieting for at least two days
Ugh, that sounds wonderful, I would do the same if I were stressed I think	In the short term, yes! They're oatmeal and peanut butter
That's amazing. Were you impressed?	One time I saw a person juggle chainsaws
That must take a lot of practice. I can't even juggle safe objects so I'd likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol	Yes, he did it perfectly and did not hurt himself
Me, too!  I work at the registration department at a college and we're very busy until school starts.	I'm very ready for school to start!
I think it's the feeling of the beginning of something new.	There's just something so nostalgic about going to school. Reminds me of my childhood.
Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you!	One time my mom made me lunch when I was too busy working!
Wow that is fantastic, she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person. :)	I hope so! She always helps me and one day I will return the favor!
Good for you friend! I'm sure you'll find something soon. What field of work do you want to be in?	My friend got a new job and I wish I had it too.
That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable.	I work in video production. Super fun job, but I'm tired of the freelance life.
Oh no, they went on vacation without you??	One time my family went out to vacation and I was home alone with no friends
Oh no that sucks, I am sorry that you had to stay home alone. What did you do to entertain yourself?	Yes, I had to work and could not get time off!
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up?	My pet cat died recently
Yes, I am sure that your cat is in a better place. If you ever want to talk to someone about it I am always here to listen. :)	I am doing okay, my cat was old and is probably in a better place now :'(
The big one? The bar? That's a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! I imagine you're very excited, but anxious too.	I am ready for my law exam
Ahh. Still, another stone set on the road to payoff. I wish you the best!	Luckily not the bar yet! Just the end of summer class.
You study hard?	I knew I was ready for my college exam.
Oh no, I bet you aced this one then.	I did. Failed my last so I knew I had to make it right.
Oh no, have you talked to him about it?	My brother keeps not washing the dishes!
Aww man, that sucks, I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off.	Yes! He is such a manchild! He does not care about cleanliness!
Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.	I was so mad when my dog got my dinner off the table.
Guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.	I did, but he knows better.
I'd imagine so. What a great time of our lives college can be. The world just seems right, being surrounded by your peers, all sharing similar goals.	I visited my college campus today and memories came flooding back. I miss it.
Mmhm. I wish I studied more, paid more attention, and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing, you're already as busy as it gets, and unfortunately you can't experience it all.	It was so great. We all just wanted to learn.
That is great, confidence is always a key in success! I believe that you will pass as well!	I think I will pass my college test tomorrow.
Yeah I bet! You will do great, I have high hopes in you! :)	Thank you. I'm ready for it to be over with.
Aw, that stinks. Why couldn't they come?	I was a bit upset when my parents could not visit me this weekend.
That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully, you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too.	My dad had to work last minute. I got everything ready for them. Oh well.
Oh man, I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar.	I was grossed out when I saw someone vomiting at a bar.
Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight	They couldn't even make it to the bathroom. Ugh.
Me too, it's so hard not knowing what to expect.	I'm very scared of the afterlife
Right, no one truly knows until they get there, so scary.	And we do not even know if we have an afterlife.
What was the book about?	I was very happy just reading a book by the pool today
I'm glad you were happy reading the book.	It was about the golden state killer. Very errie.
Oh, I understand. I also remember mine. Do you remember something else about that day?	I was very nervous for my first day of freshman year in college.
I imagine it was a big college. what did happen at the end?	I could not find my classes. It was almost comical.
Me too! I love that game!	One time I won a stuffed animal from the claw machine!
I saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters. They would cook it for you if you won.	Yup, I did it in my first try too!
Nice! How long has it been since you last saw her?	I was so happy when my mom came to visit me
Man, I hope you two do something fun!	6 months. Way too long!
All spiders or just the poisonous ones?	I am scared of spiders!
Thats fair I guess, weird fish freak me out more then spiders through	Any of them. I hate all their creepy legs.
Wow, is she an older or younger sibling?	My sister came over to my house the other day.  SHe was quick to show off her new iphone 8.
Aww man that sucks, One day your hard work will pay off, so don't let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that	She is 10 years younger than I am, and quite spoiled.  She always has the  nicest things.
omg! I hate cockroaches, they are ugly insects	One time I saw a giant cockroach under my desk!
were you able to kill it? what did you do?	Yes! they are so creepy with how fast and nasty they are1
Well done. I hope you dont find anymore, they are scary.	I sprayed it with Raid
Wow! that is really cool. Did he land the back flip?	I thought it was so cool that my friend did a backflip.
What prompted his back flip?	He did! I didn't know he could do that.
It happens sometimes.  It only becomes a problem if you forget often.	I forgot to invite my friend to dinner with our other friends.
I hope they were pretty understanding.	Luckily I have not done it too many times.
I hate burger king! McD's all the way	One time I wanted to eat at Burger King, but then I remembered that I was loyal to Mcdonalds
Adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer	Your dam right! Even if the food is small, it tastes so good!
That is unfortunate, did you fail the test?	I was upset when I did not do well on a test.
You got this! I believe in you!	Not exactly, but close enough. I will study better next time.
Wow! Did you tell them anything?	I was so mad when my friend forgot my birthday
You should stop being their friend!	I did a few days later. They seemed sorry.
Oh, snitches are no fun.	One time my friend said that I could tell him anything and she would snitch
I would just keep to myself.	Yes, snitches get stiches
Who?	I remember years ago when I was a teenager.  I didnt treat her as well as I should have.
Well I think as long as you say sorry, she can forgive.	Oh so sorry, I meant to say I didnt treat my mother as well as I should have.  I often treated her with disrespect and disobedience.
I know how annoying that can be.  I love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.	My dog kept barking and waking me up
Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!	I still do not know why he was barking.
I have done that before. It is not fun.	One time I pooped my pants when I was trying to fart
I hope you threw out those pants.	Yup! I had to walk home in shame!
Ooh, what kind of trick did she learn?	My dog learned a new trick today!
Aww! I wish I had a dog now!	shaking hands! so cute
American football or soccer?	I'm so ready for football season
Okay. I'm not really a fan of it.	american football!
Yeah, that was a surprising result.	I could not believe that Donald Trump won the election.
Does it make you feel like you're living in an alternate reality?	I still do not know what to make of it
it can be scary at times. How do you deal with it?	I did not like being alone at home at night.
That is a good way. I have a dog that makes me feel safe. Do you have anything like that?	I try to go to bed earlier.
You can watch some movies	My family left for the weekend and I'm so bored.
It depends on your preference. I watch korean dramas.	What should I watch?
Life is always a lot better when the sun is shining.	I have realized that I have it good in life
When the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile.	Yes, I appreciate everything, even the sun
That is good you have someone to share your happiness and problems with	I can definiely count on my best friend for anything
my best friend is my boyfriend. So I share everything with him	It is. Do you?
Same here! where do you volunteer at?	I love volunteering.
That is so generous of you! have you ever thought of joining a volunteer organization?	The humane society. I just love animals.
what are those	Something terrible happened. I discovered I have cankles
??? is it a cancer of some sort??	It is a terrible disease where your ankles and calves are fused together
That is excellent! I wish I had the courage to do so, too.	I love to volunteer for others
I think it would be fun to help someone build a house.	You should try! It is fun!
oh yeah? was it because you didn't know if you could do the work, or because of all the hot college girls	I was nervous for my first day of college.
well how did it go? did you do well?	Just nervous for new beginnings.
That must be nice. I wish i had one.	I played with and hugged my dog all day today!
Yes, they do. And lots of care.	You should! They need a lot of attention though!
What about it made you feel nervous?	I was nervous for my first day of college
Yeah I understand. Big life changes make me feel uneasy sometimes too.	just nervous for a new start in life
I lost my dog last year, I miss her too.	I  found some pictures of my dog I had to put down. I miss her
I agree, they are the best.	Dogs are too good to us
That must feel good.	I realized I am happy with life
Small things like what?	Yes, I am starting to appreciate lots of small things in life!
Wow thats completely unfair!	One time my mom gave my brother a Happy Meal, and I got nothing!
Well i mean sounds like favortism to me. Siblings always get the better things	Yup, it scarred me for life. I have mental issues now
Wow, lucky you. I play those once in a year only	I love to play lottery scratch offs!   I once won 4000 on one.
I do not play too much because if I do not win, I feel it is a waste of money.	I can understand that, as I usually dont have the money to play to very often.  I couldnt wait to go cash it in.
well that's good. what's the subject?	I studied all night for a test. I think I can pass it, even though I was sleepy
I hate chemistry because I think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are	Organic chemistry!
do you have a good teacher?	I agree!
Wow that is annoying. Did you get a spicy packet after?	One time they gave me ketchup packets instead of spicy sauce. I was so mad!
That is okay, mistakes happen all the time.	No, I was pouting all day!
Did you drink a lot of coffee when you were a child?	One time when I was drinking coffee, all the memories of my childhood kept coming back
I see, that is such a nice way to remember your past,.	No, but I like losing myself in my thoughts when drinking coffee!
Well did you pass or did you fail?	One time I studied all week for my final exam! I think I can pass now!
Well I guess you might want to study harder next time.	I failed unfortunately, but I liked my optimism!
oh you must love getting cancer results!	One time I went to the doctor and I was really anticipating my test results for cancer!
that's why I do it, for a great cardio workout. so what were the results?	Well it does get my heart beating fast!
and then what happened??	One time my house started flooding from a hurricane!
and then what happened	I woke up
I hope something good was on	One time I skipped my friend's birthday party to watch TV
yeah you are. what show was it?	There was! But I felt so bad afterwards. I'm a monster
Really? what kind of icecream?	One time my mom bought an ice cream from Mcdonalds!
That is a good one! it is not always broken though. Sometimes they are out of ice cream mix because the workers eat it all	A plain vanilla one. It is rare since their machine is always broken!
That is a rational fear when you are little. How did you overcome it?	One time when I was little, I was scared of going to sleep without a night light
Oh that is a bad place to go	I became depressed and I felt nothing
Oh really? What were you guys talking about?	One time there was this really cool person I was talking to on a chatroom
Aww that's so sweet <3	About topics that really impressed us. It was you <3
He must be a good person bit if he's a stranger, is it safe?	One time a person offered to drive me home when it was raining outside
That is good safety first	It was super creepy, I did not take the offer !
I am sorry to hear that! what was its name?	My cat passed away because of old age
That is cute! is there a meaning behind that name?	I called him Pizza Guy
That is good! Never accept anything less!	In all my relationships,i always choose to honest as much as i can. I never want to my partner to stop believing in me
I'm rooting for you! Get your dream person!	Exactly,you receive what you get. Nothing less.
I can imagine how it feel,more so if its someone who never leaves his/her phone down.	One time I kept waiting for this person to respond to my texts. He never did
The writing is very clear on the wall. You have been ignored.	Yes, I do not like being ignored >:(
Wow, that sounds intense! I hope you'll find out there was nothing to be stressed about after all!	i'm starting university in two days and i'm kind of stressed because i'll be studying with new teachers and i have no idea what they will be like
Well I hope you won't have any of those mean teachers! Maybe you'll have some awesome ones?	yeah but i hate having mean teachers , the ones that are not open for different ways of explaining things. so i really hope i won't have anyone like that
that's sounds amazing, you	School is starting back up soon, I can't wait to see all my friends again!
you didn't talk to any of them during summer break? is there anyone specific you're looking forward to see?	Yes, me very happy!
I feel you. I am still scared even though I am sort of successful now!	sometimes i get scared because i fear not being able to achieve my goals in life
Uncertainty is the only certainty!	it's that fear of not being able to control everything that hurts the most
Have you always felt that way or have changed your view over time?	I like to work with people who are fast on their feet and get things very fast.
Well that is a good way of doing things as long are you getting the job right in my opinion.	That is just me,we seem to get a lot of things done within a short period of time.
Yes I believe in you	i will release my project soon, and i'm so excited because i worked insanely hard on it
Your hard work will not fail you	thank you, i'm believe in myself and all the hard work i put in this project
I'm so sorry. : (	My new car was extremely damaged in a road accident last week being my very first car,i;m shuttered
Well, at least you came out without an injury? Or did you.	To make it worse,i was the one on the wrong. The insurance is seeming difficult to compensate.
Dang! What are going to do with all that free time!?	I'm very excited about this weekend. Two days with literally no plans and no responsibilities!
Nice! Well I hope you have a nice and relaxing weekend!	The plan is to just relax. Maybe some TV or a book.
Oh my god, that sounds like the most terrifying thing ever! Where was this so I know never to go there?	One time I found a cockroach in my hamburger! OMG!
Not surprising. How long did it take you before you were able to eat a burger again?	It was at Mcdonalds!
what kind of promises? who hurt you?	i hate seeing all those people breaking their promises just so they can follow their desires and wishes
what is the worst hurt you've ever seen?	nobody hurted me , it's just seeing people get hurt is kind of annoying for me
so I hear....	nobody hurted me , it's just seeing people get hurt is kind of annoying for me
Wow that sounds like good news!	I was happy because my best friend called me to ask about his first time moving away from home.
I'm glad to hear he has moved on with his life! A huge step forward.	Yeah. He was going to college. He went for a couple years. He didn't finish there.
Wait, you forgot you're vegetarian? That must've been pretty shocking	Once I was going to get fried chicken, but then I remembered I was loyal to only eating vegetables
Oooo you have to be sneaky with your meat habits, my friend	My girlfriend makes me! And she is always watching!
Who have you helped recently?	i love helping people, just seeing that smile after you finish helping them makes me so happy!
That's really kind of you. Does the old man appreciate it?	well, i always help this old man to cross the road.
You are a good example to others.	well you see, i do it more for myself , i don't really mind if the other people appreciate it or not it's more for me to be a better person.
Sounds like a great friend! Do they just listen or offer helpful advice?	I can tell my best friend anything!
Loyal and caring. You've got a winner on your hands!	I usually ask her for advice and tell her embarrassing stories because she never snitches!
good to know. and what makes you life so good, huh?	"I;m living my best life. I could'not be any happier."""
what if it all comes crashing down on you!	Family is doing great, bussines is booming
Did your mother find out?	One time I stole something from the grocery store when I was little
How have you managed it? Have you thought about returning to the store and admitting to it?	No, but the guilt haunted me for a long time!
That sounds unfair. Maybe you'll get another chance to win.	There was a race in high school I should have won. I didn't see the guy trying to pass me as he was coming out of the last turn.
Oh wow, well there is always another chance, we all learn on mistakes.	The funny part was I threw the baton at the end and got my team disqualified for the race.
I am not much of a gamer myself. What is your favourite game?	In my spare time I like to watch tech reviewers on YouTube.  But whenever I see their high end gaming PC setups it makes me want something as good for myself.
You need to save your money to be able to afford it.	My favorite game is Assassin's Creed.  It has a great story.  When I see it running on a gamer's expensive PC I wish I could get that performance.
I can sympathize with you. I've had a lot of betrayal in the past. The ONLY thing to do is to continue looking for trustworthy individuals.	"I let people so much in my life and they've ended up betraying my confidence i had in them."""
Not for naught but, a dog won't ever betray you <3	I have learnt the hard way,keep your friend circle small.
oh my god, did it take a lot of work? and did it annoy you when it fell down?	One time I was building a tower of cards that was over 8 layers tall. It fell when someone walked by
maybe this time you can do it somewhere alone?	Yes it took me over an hour! I was so mad!
Same. I hate my life. I sit in front of my computer all day	do you ever feel lonely? i do. i hate my own company and i have no friends.
Well I hope things turn out better for you	i do too, it's normal to runaway and sit in front of your computer i guess
why do you do it?	i'm ashamed of always deceiving my family.
oh I see. what do you want to do instead?	i don't do it on purpose , it's them they want me to be a doctor but i don't like medicine.
That's unfortunate. Did you make up afterwards?	i had a fight with my sibling today and she started shouting at me and it really annoyed me
That's good. You guys are siblings after all and should try to get along.	no, she still doesn't want to apologise for what she did, but eve she doesn't i'm gonna talk to her today!
hi, what makes you think that?	The possibility of winning a lottery this time is high for me
fair enough my friend, would you say your chances are high because of signs of other people winning around you recently?	Bruh,my instincts can't be wrong. I just have this crazy feeling that i might be lucky this time round.
Could she just be too distraught to pick up a phone? I agree that she owes that much to you but, maybe shes too broken atm	i recently discovered that my father is sick , i tried to contact my mother to see what happened but she didn't answer. i'm so mad at her because she didn't even try to call me again.
Hopefully you don't live too far. I know this is a random chat but, I genuinely hope your father is okay. I don't have a dad so, cherish every moment you get.	i got really angry and i'm so worried about my father. so i'm gonna go visit my parents and check on them this weekend.
Golf is by far my favourite hobby, this sounds awesome! What island was it?	The coolest place I've ever been was an island in the Caribbean. No cars, only golf cars. 100% touristy village.
I will have a look at it on my lunch break today! I did snorkelling in the Philippines at it was amazing.  That was on the island of Coron	Caye Caulker. Maybe a vacation for your partner. There's a snorkeling place there. The coolest things though was that it was unlike anywhere I've ever been.
Ooooof lmao do you work in an office?	My embarassing moment is when our thermostat was broken and my boss came in, and I had my shirt off. Only problem I guess is it would have been weird if he had had a client with him.
Thank goodness. You really dodged a bullet on that one	Yeah, insurance. No client though thankfully.
oh boy oh boy oh boy where are you going??	i'm finally gonna get some rest, i'm going on a holiday in two weeks and i really can't wait!
well, I don't want to break it to you, but those guys are fictional....	i'm going to Greece. i can't wait to see all the greek gods up close.
Did the secret negatively affect others?	I was nervous about a secret I had but I hated keeping it bottled up.
I can understand that feeling. Well, if it was pretty innocuous there's no harm and keeping confidentialiy	No, but some kind person came up to me and promised not to tell anybody.
Oh wow more responsibility! I bet the pay raise will be welcome	I am looking forward to getting a promotion. I have to hire 3 people.
Sweet! Sounds like a good job. How are the bosses?	Yes, a couple more levels and it will be easier.
thats a wonderful thing how long have you been married?	i love my wife because she's loyal and she always takes care of me.
very nice its always good to find a faithful and loving woman	for over 5 years now.
we all make mistakes , what's important is to learn from them! and you were young so it's okay you know?	when i was younger I did something I was very embarrassed about
it's good that you learned from your mistake!	yeah it was something a stupid kid does, I went into a comic book store with a friend and tried to steal a lot of comics but we were caught and I learned it was bad to steal
That's awesome! Tell me about her.	My wife is the best thing to happen to me since sliced bread
Aw, that's great to hear about happy marriages! I hope you tell her often how much you appreciate her!  I'm sure you're a great husband too.	i've been with her for 10 years and she's wonderful mother and wife and always puts her family first
Oh no! Did someone let it out?	I had a cat that I loved so much and one day I came home and I found out he had been ran over.
How old was he?	They must have. I couldn't believe what I was seeing...
Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. It's stressful. I hope your job is safe?	our company is firing people, and everyone is very sad to go
Totally. I can't imagine losing my job. Luckily the economy is pretty good, so maybe they will find new jobs quickly.	mine is good, i just feel bad for the people who got fired you know?
Why are you moving?	i'm moving out from this house and it's just very emotional.
I would feel emotional too with such a big transition in life. I am sure you will enjoy university though	well, my university is in a different city so i'm leaving everyone here to follow my dreams.
were they close to you?	when my Grandparents died, I was extremely upset for a few months
that makes sense why you got upset but in the end we're all gonna follow them and you never now you may see them again	I was really close with my Grandpa on my father's side. I used to spend every summer with them when I was as child
That is so heartwarmingly sweet. I know exactly how you feel since my family means the world to me as well.	My whole world revolves around my family they make me very happy
It's true they grow up so fast. This is why we should appreciate every second we have with them.	they are my reason to live for sure, I don't look forward to my kids growing up and moving out
What do you do?	I have been in my job for 3 years now, and I feel quite comfortable and happy here
Oh wow- Do you have a college degree?	I am a project manager. I started off very junior, and now I have worked my way up in the company
Why do you find it hard to throw away old stuff	When I had to clear out my old bedroom when I left home, I really found it hard to throw away a lot of the stuff in there!
So what are you planning to do	Just thinking of all the good times I had with toys / books etc when I was a child! Even though I wouldn't use these things again, it was still hard to throw away
Oh no, I've had that happen before, it is the worst. I hope it wasn't too bad for you!	I got really drunk on my birthday this year, and couldn't remember what I did. It was very awkward meeting my friends the next day
I understand that all too well! I'm glad it wasn't too bad though. I've had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover.	It  wasn't that bad in the end, but it was the fear of not remembering anything!
did you apologise to him? maybe next time try to not drink a lot so you can control yourself?	I got really drunk on my birthday and was horrible to one of my oldest friends, i felt awful
i'm glad it made you more aware of what you're doing.	I did apologise to him the next day, and I had a lot of making up to do. I don't usually get nasty when I drink alcohol, but this has made me be more careful
What are you going to do to change that?	The future looks bright though right now things are not going as i had planned
Keep your head up high, good positive thinking.	Keep doing my best in whatever i do. I'm sure all shall be well.
What did you do to it?	I found an abandoned cat in an alleyway yesterday.
You are such a sweet soul. They say adopt and rescue ,don't buy	I took it home with me, I felt bad for it.
I wish I could have heard your speech. it must have been really funny.	When I gave a best man speech at my Dad's wedding, I knew that I was going to do well and make everyone laugh
I hope he had a wonderful wedding. He must have been proud of you.	I don't think anybody recorded it which is a shame! My Dad loved it though which is the main thing
Did you get the job? Or you're still waiting on the response?	The last interview I went to, I studied the company, as well as the role. I felt like I had all the info I needed to succeed
You must be really proud of yourself. That sounds really fulfilling!	I did get the job - the company were really impressed with my knowledge of what they did, and my enthusiasm for the role
well if this isn't a great start for summer i don't know what is	Summer starts next week, and I got A's in all my classes this year.
of course you won't, have an amazing summer!	I wouldn't change a thing in the world right now.
Oh it can really hurt	When my ex girlfriend cheated on me, I was so angry
Its fair that way	At least it wasn't with a close friend - it was someone I didn't know. At least i didn't have to be angry with 2 people i knew!
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. You must be very worried about her!	My younger sister who is 14 years is pregnant with her 16 years old boyfriend. Arrrgh
Oh gosh, all you can do is try to be there for her.  But yes, 14 is so young to be a mother. I'd be very upset too. I'm sorry.	Worried least to say,teenage pregnancy with not best formal education. I'm lost for words.
Must have really brought back good memories. I love nostalgia.	When I played the new Crash Bandicoot remastered games, it made me remember the good times in my childhood
It's a great thing these companies are doing letting you re-live the good old days when you're older!	It's great! I'm really looking forward to playing the new Spyro games too!
Oh no, how embarassing! Did anyone see?	Today I slipped when I was walking to class on campus.
I hate it when that happens! I hope you didn't hurt yourself, and that somebody tried to help?	Yes! There was like 12 people near me! I couldn't believe my luck.
How did it eventually go?	I remember when I submitted my CV to a company, I couldn't wait to get a response, hoping that it was positive!
Congratulations on a new job	I got the good response I was anticipating. I put a lot of work into my CV, and the application, so I was very happy with the result
Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. That really sucks, maybe you can reapply soon?	I was upset not to get a response back from a company that I applied for a job at
I can understand that. I think the next company you apply for will be your time to shine!	I suppose I could, but I'm not sure I want to apply again as they didn't treat with any respect, and ignored my application
Oh no! I confess I have done that to my kids!	My Parents tried to make me eat some gone off food once, It made me really ill
Ha, that's good! Mine haven't gotten sick from it either. I just hate to waste food!	I have too now that I have kids of my own!! I think that the use by dates on food are more of a guideline, and so far they haven't got ill!
Amazing, did you revise for it, or are you naturally clever?	I had a quiz yesterday and I went through it like nothing.
That's cool - I never had the concentration to study that much	I studied all week for it. I came prepared.
Oh man, I would have moved out the next day.	I thought I saw a ghost once in my old apartment, it scared the hell out of me!
I don't blame you. I've never seen one before, I'd hate to see one.	Yeah it wasn't long before I did move out! I never believed in ghosts until then, and it still creeps me out!
Oh no. May I ask what you did wrong?	I got arrested when I was younger, and I was so scared in the back of the police car
Where did they take you? Back to your parents or to the police station?	I got caught drinking under age. I got off without being charged, but it was very scary!
Did it work? Did you ever do it again?	They took me back to my parents, but I think they just wanted to give me a bit of a scare!
Well try to stay out of trouble now you are a bit older!	I didn't do it for a long time, but I eventually did as I got a bit older
were you happy for him? or did you get sad because you didn't want that to happen?	When my dad told me he was getting married, I was over the moon
that's great, i'm glad she's nice to you.	I was delighted for him, his new wife is so great for him, and she's always been really cool to me
That's wonderful news, congratulations! Are you going to celebrate?	When I got told that I had a new job, I was over the moon
I am so happy for you. You should get a nice dinner with your family.	I am definitely going to celebrate! It is my dream job
did he find out?	I stole money from my dad once, i felt terrible for ages
thats good you told him. Thats a lot to keep inside. Hopefully he wasnt mad	He did eventually, I actually told him when the guilt got too much for me
Ohhhh, that is so bad. Why did you cheat?	I cheated on my ex girlfriend, and I felt bad about it ever since
Oh no, sorry about that. But have you confessed to her	I got drunk - i felt really guilty about it
well that's great news congratulations, how long have you known each other?	When i proposed to my girlfriend, she said yes! I was so happy
that's good that you put a lot of effort into it	We have known each other for 7 years, and been dating for 5 - felt like the right time
haha, amazing! did you get shouted at?	I remember when I was in my 20's I was so drunk that I accidently went into the womans rest room
That's really embarassing! did any of your friends poke fun at you for it?	No but a lot of people saw me do it and my face went beet red
What happened exactly? Is it just old and moldy?	I need new carpet for my house so I cannot wait to get my income tax return this year
At least you got your moneys worth! Are you going to have it installed?	no its just 17 years old and needs to be replaced
That is so lovely	I remember growing up and having some really good family vacations
Memories are good to be kept in the medulla. Good old days. You really had a good time	yes I had a good childhood with wonderful memories even though we didn't have a lot of money
Aw. When you know, you know. How did you do it?	When I proposed to my wife I knew she was going to say yes I just felt it
I bet it was really special though! Christmas is such a beautiful time of year. When are you getting married?	I was rather cheesy and proposed to her on christmas
That's too bad. Do you have proof of infidelity?	In the relationships I have been in i have never cheated, I have suspicions that the guys I was with did though.
It's good that you're faithful. Too bad your boyfriend couldn't be less flirtatious and respect you more.	Not really, but my one boyfriend was always very flirty and liked hooking up with girls a lot
What kind of food does it serve? Sounds wonderful!	A new restaurant opened near my house, and it turned out to be really really nice
Surf and turf! That's what they called a steak served with seafood. It's very yummy!	It is a Spanish restaurant, and they serve Steaks and Fish chargrilled. It is my new favourite place to eat!
That's good, I love relaxing outside by a pool.	I felt totally relaxed when I was outside watching my kids play in the pool.
That's always a good feeling.	Yeah it was like I had no stress.
oh man dogs are crazy! My dog killed a cat recently, I hope it's not poison!! Is he okay?	My dog was chewing on dead frog. So gross!! I hope it was not poisonous.
oh no, you are a good dog owner though	He seems to be ok but if he start salivating then for sure there is poison. I will have to run to vet!!
Sounds like you are doing all the right things. Did anything go wrong?	When I bought my house I made sure I had everything all ready including my down payment
Oh that is great! Congratulations on your knew home! That must be so exciting!	no it took 2 weeks to close and no issues came up
that's the coolest thing ever I didn't know you could have them as pets	I am so happy today because my peacocks just had 3 babies! They are so cute!
My kids would love something like that	Oh yes! I have 3 adult females and one male. I have had them for 5 years. They have names and I can call them and they come running to me. They are cool pets.
Monkeys!!!??? I have never heard monkeys howl.  Tell me more.	Lately I hav been hearing some big monkeys howling up in the mountain. I hope they don't come down near my house.
Where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains?  I live in Florida, the flatlands. lol	It is hard to give you an example through text but it does sound like a monster in the mountains. Kind of scary! haha
"Sounds exciting.  But I would have been scared of howling monkeys too.  I am not sure why, but the term ""howling monkeys"" makes me giggle."	I live in Florida too but have a second home in Mexico. They are in the jungles and are wild there.
Bye! Watch out for those monkeys!	Haha, It is a funny situation. Chat with you later my friend!
oh that is so exciting!!! good for you man!	just heard I got the promotion I was hoping for. I think I am going to burst.
yeah pop that champagne!	thanks, i thing I am going to celebrate when I get home tonight
That sounds awesome! What's your favorite part of your vacation so far?	I am on vacation in Bali and I want to move here so badly. It is the most beautiful place in the world!
What kinds of fruit do they have there?	I love hiking through the rice fields and the fruit here is out of this world!!
That's great that they let you work in exchange for lessons. I bet you have the best memories.	WHen I was about 13 years old I worked at a horse farm in exchange for lessons.  I would go there every weekend and all through the summer.
That's awesome. Do you own a horse now?	Yes I have very fond memories from those days.  I can still remember the smell of the farm and the smell of horses like it was yesterday.  I never wanted to wash the smell from my hands and I would daydream about owning my own horse someday.
That's awesome! Yeah I definitely find the more I study, the better I do. Funny how that works!	Studied for my math finals for days, felt very confident on the day of the test.
True. There has to be a work/school/life balance.	Yeah, but theres a balance. study too much and you just burn yourself out
Well I hope he gets to felling better.	My dad got sick for a week and I stayed at home for a week taking care of him
You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.	He's better already but he got a real bad fever during that week
That's very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.	I drank all the milk in the fridge and left nothing for anyone else. Next week I will buy extra milk for the house to make up for it.
Lol it happens, what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.	Yeah, I have done that before and I got yelled at by everyone. I learned my lesson. Haha
Awww, I never had one, but wanted one.	Looking through old stuff in the attic and stumbled across my old gamecube, sadly it didn't work anymore.
What were your favorite games?	Yeah i had good memories playing with my friends
Wow, thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?	My old roommate didn't clean out his room or kitchen when he left. My school charged the rest of us $100 because of him.
Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again, just loan them $20.	No, he cut off all communication. Nobody liked him anyways, he was dirty and rude.
I'm sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?	I was disappointed with the score of my final exam. I studied real hard but got a 64% on it.
Well that's good news. I hope you do better on your next test.	Yea i had a study group I just panicked when i entered the testing room i think. It's not so bad though, i still passed the class.
Aw, I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.	I live very far away from my family and I miss them dearly. I feel so alone sometimes.
That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.	Yes it is quite hard. But it has been my choice to move away. I guess one day I will return but not sure when.
Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.	One time in high school I sat in chocolate sauce! I didn't have a sweater to tie around my waste, so I had to borrow one from a friend.
Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!	One of the bully kids noticed the sweater around my waste on the warm day and knew something was up. He really tried to embarrass me.
Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?	Recently moved to a new dorm and when i came in the kitchen was a total disaster. Months old piles of dishes in the sink with mold and dried up old food on the stove.
I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.	I can but they take forever to come and clean it up. I just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won't do it again. Spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox, alcohol, and soap.
Did you pass?	When i was waiting for my final grade report to come in. I was scared i was going to fail my organic chem class.
Absolutely. Great job!	Yeah, got a 73% on the class. Not ideal but better than failing.
I completely agree, having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits	I have complete faith in my diet. It makes me feel great!
Yeah, and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!	It's easier to maintain than people realize!
Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?	I was driving down the highway during a heavy thunderstorm and two cars crashed in front of me and one flipped over.
Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok.	Yeah im alright, i was far enough to steer clear of the chaos. The guy that flipped had to get carried by ambulance, but he didn't look very injured. and the other guy was ok.
Oh no, poor dog :( I'd be devastated too, i love dogs so much.	My dog died in my neighbors electrical fence last night. I am devastated!! I don't know what to do.
Don't beat yourself up over it, it was a very tragic accident but who could've known. He's in a better place now.	My heart is broken and I can't stop crying. I feel so helpless that I could not save her.
That was nice of her. Did everything work out?	Recently, my wife and I needed a babysitter for the evening, and my mother-in-law offered to watch our kids.
Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?	No, she forgot.  Which, unfortunately, is typical!
Yeah I thought of that. well, the kids probably loved it!	Yeah, it worked out okay to take the kids with. It just wasn't quite as relaxing.
Very nice.  How many shoes do you have?	I really enjoy collecting shoes, and i'm hoping to get a pair of Yeezy's that are restocking this october.
Are they all Yeezys?	i have around 7 right now
That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?	I feel so happy to live out in the country. Nature is the most beautiful thing to experience everyday!
Yeah, that's not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!	Only about a 30 minute drive. Not to close and not to far. But we grow some of our food here and we have cows and chickens too.
Oh yes.  The first car is amazing	Back in highschool when i got my first car, i was so happy and drove it around for a while and it felt so nice being free to roam.
Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.	Yeah its a great feeling having someone thats yours.
I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.	I feel anxious when I have to wait for people that are late. Why can't everyone just be on time?
Yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!	Yes totally agree! Maybe I should just leave and make them wait. Haha
I agree, it's something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?	It's really hard to stay disciplined and watch what you eat.
I've tried a few, and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.	I haven't done anything specific with diets, no.  Have you found one that you like?
That's so cool! Did they get you anything nice?	It was my birthday and my whole family threw a party for me after work. It was so unexpected!,5|5|5_5|5|5,
Time to go shoppin lol!	They got me a bunch of gift cards to my favorite stores. They are all so wonderful. I love them so much!
Aw Im sorry. Are you doing better now?	At the beginning of the year I missed a lot of work.  I was sick but I didnt feel like a team player at the time.
That's a good idea. I haven't done that in years. I always feel like I barely dodge a bullet by not getting it.	yeah I'm doing much better thanks.  I'll for sure be getting a flu shot next year!
Glad you are doing better!	I have been lucky in the past but I dont remember the last time I have felt that sick. I definitely dont want to go through that again.
I feel you, but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation.	i have to go out of town, i am not looking forward to flying
I see, I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight, to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.	i keep telling myself flying is safe but I am petrified of getting on that plane
That's awesome. I was always a daddy's boy growing up.	My father has been such a great father. He is such a hard worker and loves his family so much. He is such a great man.
Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.	Awww, yeah Daddy's can be the best! I wish all children could have good daddy's.
I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?	I have a stuffed animal that my old dog used to lay by/on as a pillow. My dog is dead but I still keep that stuffed animal to remind me of him
I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)	He was about 12.  He was my first dog though! He was a sweetheart.  It is nice keeping something to remind me of him.
Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?	I was hoping to get an interview for a higher position and was told I would get that at least.  However, the recruiter didnt look at internal candidates and by the time it was reported they had hired someone from the outside.
Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.	My boss said the recruiter is an idiot and just never looked at internal candidates. It was a bummer but I figure I'll look for something else in the company soon
Oh man, that is exciting! Do you know what kind?	I am getting a new car this week! I can't wait to smell the new leather seats!
That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations, that's great news!	It's a beautiful 2018 yellow jeep! The car of my dreams! So stoked!
That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?	A bird fell out of a tree next to my house. I am now the mother and taking care of her. We are developing such a beautiful relationship.
Aww, I'd love to see a video of that.	I think it is a love bird. She thinks I am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when I call her. I have never had a pet bird before.
You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.	I met a cow the other day and I went to go pet her. Something inside me told me to get away. Later that day the owner told me to stay away from her because she is known to attack people.
Good thing you listened to your gut feeling	Yes I think so. That probably could have killed me. But I guess it was not my time. I angels saved me.
Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.	I need to go to the grocery store but it is storming outside. Not sure if I should go or not.
Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.	Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.
Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?	i came home yesterday, i found my sofa torn up, let's say this I am not very  happy with my pet dog
Yeah, I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.	i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it
Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself, animals like to play with each other!	I am so hurt that my baby goat died. My dogs were playing to rough and killer her. Man I should have stopped it sooner. It is all my fault. :(
That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.	Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.
That sounds great, I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?	I went fishing with my 4 year-old about a month ago.
Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.	He did!  He caught 4 fish all by himself.
Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?	My dog was stung by a bug.  His lip got huge and looked really funny but I felt terrible for him!
I bet he did, I'm glad he's okay though.	I did end up taking him in. Luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later.  He looked so sad with his big lip!
Thats really nice you have a friend like that.That's hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.	my best friend friend helped me through some rough spots with my marriage and job. I am gland he was there for me
I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.	thank you, i do not know how i will repay him back, I will always be in his debt
I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.	I feel so bad to see so many homeless people on the streets these days. I hope I am never homeless.
It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing	Yeah especially when it is snowing outside. Can you just imagine having to sleep outside like that . Oh! So sad!
That sounds fun! Where did you go?	I went out to eat with my girlfriend last week.  It was an awesome atmosphere and the food was great!
Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!	We went to a greek place.  There were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers. I think we'll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!
I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.	as I walk through my house, the rooms are empty, There is no one there for me
I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.	that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with
What kinds of pets do you have?	I have no children but I have a ton of animals. I love them all so much. They are my children.
oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.	I have chickens, ducks, parrots, cockatiels, budgies, peacocks, guinea pigs, dogs, goats and cows. haha
Did he have superpowers?	When my son was born, we knew that something was up before he came out.  It was pretty scary.
That's pretty impressive.	Hah - no.  But he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice, and he'd tied an overhand knot in it, too.
Oh wow, are you going to be in front of anyone important?	I was in a rush this morning and I dressed my self in stained clothes. I feel so dirty today. :(
Usually, you are the one who notices it the most.	Not today. I just feel insecure about it, like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.
wow, that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too, i presume.	My cows are finally pregnant. I can't wait for my baby calves to be born!
very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun	Oh, yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.
Awww, I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly.	i miss my old pet dog, i feel so empty without her around
Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.	i know that what makes it harder not having her around, no companionship
That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!	I am so envious of those that can travel the world and get paid for it.
Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one.	Yeah, maybe in my next life I guess, haha.
Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married	When I was in high school there was a senior I had a crush on and I was a sophomore.  I ended up asking her out but got rejected. Later on in college we actually became pretty good friends.
you dont still have any feelings at all for her?	Haha, I hope not...my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! She's a nice person (the one from high school) but I dont think I could ever marry her
Ooh, I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!	I am learning how sew my own clothes. I am studying hard and I think I will be able to make my first outfit!
Omg, that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.	Yes, I have so many ideas! How cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own!
Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time.	I just made a huge feast and now I am excited for all my guests to arrive to my baby shower!
Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.	Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.
Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed!	I trust the way my body feels to know if I'm generally healthy or not
It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.	Exactly! The human body is interesting!
Oh no, how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid.	I went to a restaurant and after I got the bill I realized that I did not have my wallet on me! The manager was yelling at me demanding me to pay before I left.
That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral.	Yes, he did want to get paid but I needed to go home and get my wallet. He got angry with me but what could I do? I had no money with me.
That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in.	I just left but I came straight back and paid. All was fine in the end. But I will never go to that restaurant again.
Oh man I want that too! did you get it?	I really wanted an Oculus Rift.  I saved up enough and had to wait about a week before it was in stock at the store
Do you use your computer?	I did!  It is by far the coolest thing I have ever bought!
How much do they go for?	yeah, I have it plugged into my computer.  I cant tell you, or even begin to explain, how real everything feels when you use it.
thats not bad. I have a rx 280	It was $400, having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece
Moving, is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?	I had to help my dad move some heavy stuff around this past weekend.
That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.	Yeah.  He kept up with me pretty well.
Oh man, I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up.	my neighbor dog is always barking, I can't stand it
That can make it so hard to sleep at night.	i know the worst part is my bedroom is near the fence and the dog barks all night
Aw man, childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries.	When I was a little girl my favorite childhood character was Strawberry Shortcake. I miss those days smelling my little figurines that smelled like strawberries.
Haha, clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood!	Yeah, I also remember having my strawberry shortcake themed birthday party. There were strawberries everywhere! I bet you could guess what flavor the cake and ice cream were, lol.
Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?	my neighbor dog barks all day, I like to go over there and tell him where he can put that dog at,
If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.	that is the problem, he does nothing, except give me his little mustache smile, one of these days i'll wipe that smile off his face
Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.	I feel so sad to see the world in the state that it is in but I am confident that times are changing and humanity is actually good.
Agreed!	Yes that is true. The ying and the yang. But I think most people are good though.
You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same, sadly. But so happy for you!	My childhood was great. I have mainly positive memories of it.
I guess it all comes down to karma, if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)	Yeah life ends up pretty dark for tons of people. It's slightly absurd when you think far into it!
what did you end up doing?	I decided to try and get some projects knocked out a couple of nights ago, but needed to keep my kids occupied.
It's good to have a partner.	Luckily, my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!
I have a son, it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.	My wife took the kids over to her mother's one evening before I got home from work.  I thought it'd be pretty nice to have a quiet house for once.
You must have been very happy when they returned home.	It was for a while, but it was too quiet for me!  I've gotten used to the noise.
Did you get it?	I tried for a promotion at work recently.  It's been a while since I've gotten a raise, so I worked pretty hard at it.
That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you.	No, they ended up giving it to someone with less experience.
That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully, you did not lose too much.	I went to the casino with my brother and the only thing he could do was win! The only thing I could do was lose.
Yeah, but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.	Nope, I'm a little careful when I go out there.  It would have been nice to join in on the winning though!
Hey, that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?	I interviewed for a job.  I know I gave great answers to their questions and walked away feeling like the job was mine.
Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?	Probably next week sometime. I'm really excited!
You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?	I work in tech support.  One issue I was given the details before and got to do research before I worked with the customer.  It was great knowing what to do before it happened.
That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!	yeah! I pretty much knew all the steps that I needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome.
Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!	my girlfriend just got promoted at her job. I am really glad for her.
Oh, I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!	i knew she could and would get the promotion, i feel like i am going to burst
I also have two older puppies, training takes time and care and love.	I have been working on potty training my dog and she has been doing great! Last night though she went a TON in the house right after I brought her out.
Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.	It definitely does!  I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.
i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.	I was packing up things to move from my girlfriends house and found her son's lite brite.  It reminded me of my childhood and playing with that toy.
i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games.	It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!
Moving can be stressful for sure, hopefully you had some help?	I had a move a couple weekends ago.  I was really planning on getting everything done, or at least moved over, in one weekend.
It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization.	yeah, the help was great and we did end up getting everything over.  Now the fun part is unpacking the boxes!
That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?	I had a great weekend with my son, we did a ton of fun things.  At the end of the weekend his attitude changed and he didnt want to listen at all.
I bet that worked!	I made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time
Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.	My dog went number 2 in the middle of the night inside.  The next morning she threw up everything...it was the worst smelling pile of stuff I've ever smelled.
I bet, hope the dog is feeling better though.	Sorry about that! Yeah, it was a terrible thing to wake up to!
interesting, what was the issue?	I used to have a boxer puppy that was so sweet and adorable.  HOwever he had on issue that I could not stand.
oh man, that is an issue, i hope he grows out of it	Well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor.   HOwever he would then eat it!!!!!   I could smell it but not find it anywhere.   He would come running into the living room wanting to lick you on the face with poop breath!
I bet you cant wait.  WHere are going for your vacation?	next week my vacation starts. I am really looking forward to it
Miami sounds like a great place to go for a vacation.   I wish I was going with you!	i always wanted to visit Miami, i can't wait to visit the beach and take in all  the fun
That sucks! What were they upset about?	One of my coworkers was outright belligerent today.
It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.	I don't even know!  She does that sometimes, and just badgers you.  I can't figure out what fires her up.
That's exciting! When will she be moving in?	My girlfriend is moving in.  I was pretty calm when we first started talking about it.  I'm really excited but there is so much to pack up!
Does she live far away?	In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast, I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her, its just the move that will not be fun
That sounds very frustrating.	My wife and I are trying to build a house, and keep running into delays getting the permits.
Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.	It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out.
What happened?	I was home alone last night playing a VR game.  It took a really creepy turn that I really wasnt expecting at all.
I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.	It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.  I dont know if you've ever tried VR but everything feels SO real.  It was pretty scary
Congrats!  How exciting for you.	a job I applied and interview for a couple of months ago offered me the job. It was unexpected.
That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.	thank you, when they called, I did not know who it was at first, then it was, wow I got the job
It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.	My husband, I think you've met him, he's been having a hard time finding a job recently. He's been in the final two candidates THREE times but no luck!
I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.	Well, he's got another interview on Thursday. I just know he will get that one!
What subject did you choose?	i needed help with choosing a subject to major and my brother helped
Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.	I chose finance and economics
why was the officer yelling at her?	I felt ashamed seeing the police officer yelling at the old lady
wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady	She was trying to cross the road and accidentally had her phone fall, the officer thought she was insane
That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.	My mother has been a caring mom since i got ill a week ago
It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.	Yah, i feel loved so much
Sorry about that, you could have taken a taxi	I had to walk home from work last night after I got off late at night, it was kind of scary.
good enough you got home safe	It was a short enough walk, I just stayed aware of my surroundings and got home safe.
Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.	Today I was looking through my childhood photos and writings, it made me a little emotional and nostalgic.
Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.	I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.
That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?	I slept through a really important class because I was hungover and I failed because of it. I should've behaved better.
No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.	I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that, I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.
That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!	I had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick. I tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible.
Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!	He did, he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick, it helps to have someone to care for you.
Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?	I once got in a really bad accident on my way home from work and it really upset me
That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen.	luckily the only problem I had was my neck was sore for a few weeks but nobody else was hurt
Oh that's great, its awesome when the kids go off to school each year.	Hi! I had a great day with my emotions with my child going to school!
You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time, haha.	Yes - this is m child's first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me. You know how it is! Parent life.
Wal-Mart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened, I'm dying to know!	I just had a weird experience at Wal-Mart today!
Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?	Well, I was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  There was a gas station a small walk away though!
That must have been a very windy day!	I'm going to cut to the chase here. Just blurt it on. My DRESS blew up in front of parents and children the other day when it was windy.
I bet It will teach you.	I wanted to run and hide.  I haven't' worn a dress since.
I go to church every Sunday I love it.	i felt great last year when i started going to church again
The people you can meet are super.	yeah its a great feeling getting back into church !
That	I felt very grateful last week when an elderly women paid for my gas
That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.	Yeah its nice when people do kind things like this it doesn't happen very often now day
So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do?	When I lived on my own, I found it hard without having any company
Yes, usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends, but eventually it will happen.	I was used to having family or friends around most of the time in my old place, but then I moved away. I had to make new friends which I found very difficult
That was really nice of your old friends.	I eventually made friends through work, and it is really nice when my old friends come to visit too
Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?	I love the gifts that i received last week on my birthday
Nice. What brand of shoes were they?	A pair of shoe
That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?	I felt a bit sad last week when i saw an elderly man drop his wallet and a kid picked it up and didn't give it back to the man
I'm glad he was able to catch him.	Yeah eventually the kid was caught i told the man and he caught him shortly after
Wow, how was it? I have never seen that trailer.	I saw the movie trailer about Paul Walker's life today. It made me so sad!
Aww, that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies!	It was just sad. I love Paul Walker and his movies. I still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous. In a fast car.
Are they twins?!	Speaking of babies, I got to meet my nephews yesterday!
Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!	Yes!  They are so sweet. I don't even like kids and I really felt my heart warm up to them.
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?	The other day something happened that made me want to run and hide.
I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.	It didn't happen to me directly, but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.
I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it?	My girlfriend and I were watching a series on Netflix.  She wasnt home and I ended up watching a couple episodes ahead of where we were at.
Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them.	She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean, I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!
That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?	I moved last weekend.  I was really happy once everything was done and it went smoothly.
That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.	Yeah, unpacking and all that fun stuff now.  I really like the new place though.
Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?	I'm not in a good mood! My husband got to go to a basketball game. I wish I could have too!
Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun.	I have to stay home with our son.  It is hard for us to find a baby sitter for him.
Was it a lot of fun?	I went to a friend's wedding this weekend!
That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!	Oh gosh yes. I wore a beautiful dress. I felt so pretty!
It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.	Thank you! I feel like a slob lately.
What a great feeling! You must love your dog.	it is nice to have a loving pet , My dog is always there for me
She sounds like a great companion.	i really do, no matter what happens, she will always be by my side
Are you looking forward to it?	Hello! I started my graduate classes today.
Exciting! I'm sure you'll do fine.	Yes. I have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff.  I'm nervous but ready!
Why is that?	I really need to change doctors!
Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.	He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name
I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.	I was playing a VR game home alone.  It took a really creepy turn towards the end of the game.
That would keep me up at night.	It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.
Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future.	yesterday i ate a whole big bag of M&Ms, i don't feel proud of myself
I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow.	i hope so, i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed
Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.	We recently got a new puppy. My older dog waits his turn and knows the puppy should go outside to the bathroom first.
Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.	It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.
I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.	We've been really struggling with potty training my son.
That is awesome. I am proud of him	Thanks, we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night, though!
gotta risk it for the biscuit	I went out with some friends a couple weekends ago and we met a group of girls. One asked for my number but I told her I have a girlfriend and didnt give it out.
i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping	Haha, I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.
It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!	i have a presentation due this week, I am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others
You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.	i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others
Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?	I felt very bad when my boss did not approve of my work. It just makes me more motivated to work harder.
I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.	Yes, I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(
Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!	My roommate moved out and soon my girlfriend will move in but right now it is just me in the house. I dont remember the last time I lived without any roommates.
Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!	It does feel a little lonely.  It's weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person.
Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.	I feel so happy when the sunsets are beautiful and I can take the time to watch and relax. It is the best time of the day for me.
It reminds you of how beautiful life is.	Yeah, it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world.
Wow, that's rude! He won't last long...	Man the new guys at work were slandering our boss so bad.
Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!	I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.
Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?	My sister is having another baby! I can't wait to meet her! This will be her fourth child.
LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!	Only one more month to go. She is about the explode though! Glad it is her and not me, lol.
You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.	Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha
I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary	There was a random dog in my yard yesterday morning.  He didn't look mean but I wasn't sure I wanted to mess with him.
I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.	It was!  I didn't want to chase him off either.  Thankfully he just kind of wandered away.
Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it	I bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change. She gave me too much change actually. I did not realize until later after I left the store.
The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long.	I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.
That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?	So I was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees.  They were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions.
I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.	My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch.
Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap.	So I lost the ring that my best friend gave me when he moved out of country.  We had matching ones made and it's really breaking my heart.
I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.	It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.
Sweet! Where did you go?	We had a pretty fun family vacation about a month ago.
That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!	We went to a lake not far from here.  We had a ton of fun on the boat . . . nobody else was on the water one of the days!
I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?	I work in tech support.  Every once in a while a customer will want our software to do something it either cant or is not built for.
Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?	I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.
oh no! hope all is well with your dog.	I had to take my dog to the vet yesterday and I had full confidence they would take care of his problems. They are so good there.
Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did.	Thank you. Other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well. Just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed.
BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?	So we went out to that new BBQ place to eat the other night.
Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.	It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange.
i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)	I really loathe meetings.  They're usually so pointless.
lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any.	That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However, I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!
That's terrible! What did you do?	Oh man.  I was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy!
That's good. I'm glad your alright.	I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.
Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset.	Once in Kindergarten, a pair of my underwear got stuck in my shirt and fell out in the middle of the classroom.
Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you	I was! I thought I was going to get in trouble
What kind of car was it?	the other day I was looking at old pictures of a car i use to own. I miss that car.
Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it	i was an old Cadillac, reason I miss it, lot of memories of family and friends riding in it
OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?	i just lost my pet dog. I do not know what to do.
I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.	i cannot find her anywhere, she is missing, it feels like I have a part of me missing
Good job! How do you think you did on it?	It was wonderful not having to worry about my most recent exam, knowing I was prepared.
That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!	I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.
Yeah I like going straight to the point too	I packed for a long road trip, and had everything I would need to hopefully avoid excessive stops.
I like when I get places earlier than expected	Definitely. Nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn't pack enough food and didn't plan bathroom breaks.
I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?	I had a dentist appointment yesterday.  I hate going to the dentist!
That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!	Yes I had to get a filling in my very back tooth.  THe dentist said I had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if I started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve.   I was scared the whole time.
Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?	My son wouldnt sleep last night.  He kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room.
Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!	He just didnt want to sleep. I think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point.
That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college	My son graduated pre-school.  It isnt much but its that next step in his school career.
College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.	Haha, I hope not too soon!  I was really happy, he is growing pretty fast!
That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind	I'm going to a beer dabbler this weekend.  It has been very busy the last couple weeks so I'm really looking forward to drinking and relaxing this weekend.
I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.	I think so.  I'm hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!
That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.	I'm trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room.  I know he wants to be by me and I can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights
Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.	I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!
That is so sweet. What is her name?	i do love my pet doggy, she is a treat to have
I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.	Angie, i like to give her a warm bath, dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat
That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long.	We just got a new puppy.  My older dog knew to let that one out first when I got home from work.
That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.	Definitely not.  I was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!
That's good. How is it going?	I used to have my dog in his crate when I left for work.  Lately I have been letting him out more and more in the house when I've been gone.
That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it.	It's going well!  So far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything.
I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?	I was driving down the road and I almost hit a dog! I was so close. Really scary!
I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.	Yes, he came out of nowhere and I slammed on my brakes. My tires skid across the road.
lol, guess you were pretty hungry	I finished all the ice cream when I was told to leave some for others. I was just so hungry!
yeah, might wanna go replace it	Yeah, now I am scared somebody will find out. I better go buy some more before anyone gets home. Haha
That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?	I am the happiest in my life when I am at the ocean. There is just something so special about nature at the ocean for me.
Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.	I don't really have a favorite. They are all my favorite! But I prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything. Like a huge swimming pool!
i sure it was beautiful	I saw Dubai from the airplane one day. I never went into the city, but wow, it was a sight to see!
really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment	It looked like another planet or something. Very sci-fi. Almost scary actually.
yuck, how gross!!	I found out that my neighbors eat turtle meat. How gross!!!
lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner	Yeah, who does that? I have three pet turtles so I better keep a good watch on them. lol
Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for your family.	I felt very sad recently when i found out that my mother has cancer
I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!	Thank you .  Shes a fighter i hope she can push through
why do you live so far from family	I don't have many friends and my family lives very far away. I sometimes feel very sad.
i would like a new life. i totally understand	It is just where I ended up in life. You know one thing leads to another and your living a whole knew life.
what? that scary	I heard a really loud bang in the middle of the night. the next morning I found out that it was gun shots. OMG
wow, a hard lesson	Someone was grabbed from their home and brought out to the street and was shot in the foot. Guess they wanted to teach him a lesson.
I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.	My internet connection keeps breaking! How am I going to get all my work done?
Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.	It always happens when there are electrical storms. It seems to be storm season around here.
That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?	I feel very blessed that I have been able to live around the world my whole life. Now I am settled in one place for awhile.
What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too.	My father was in the military so I lived all over the world my first 20 years of life. My favorite place is Spain.
That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.	My guinea pig had 5 babies but all of them died. I don't know why...
yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies	Yeah, it is terrible. I just wish I knew why but oh well. She will have more babies in a couple months.
I am going on a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu! I can't sleep because of the anticipation!	Hello!
I hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history.	WOW im so jealous! You lucky dog.
Yes, my friends are coming with me. :)	I have heard the same. Are you going with anyone else?
Congrats! Did you do it because of football season?	I just got cable installed in my new house, I was so excited waiting for the cable guy to come!
Cool! Whats your favoirite? I like the office.	I honestly do not really watch football but I most excited to catch up on some of my favorite TV shows.
I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.	Right now I am really enjoying Mr. Robot. I've never seen The Office but I always hear wonderful things about it.
Same here! I am glad you are doing well! :)	life seem like it is going pretty good for me, I have no complaints.
I hope these feelings last for you!	i am glad you are doing well also. I like my job and i have a loving family, no complaints here.
A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?	My dog just had a baby and I did not even know she was pregnant! What!!
I don't know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot, but what's one more?	I am not sure yet. I already have 4 dogs. I want to because he is so cute!
Well I'm sure he will be, most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.	My boyfriend is going out with a bunch of people I don't know tonight. But I trust him that he will be a good boy.
Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.	Yeah. I was in a bad relationship before with a man that was extremely untrustworthy so sometimes I get a bit crazy sometimes.
Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong	I get so upset when someone does not agree with what I am doing. I am a grown women and feel I can make good choices for myself.
Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.	Yes, it is like they don't have a life of their own and want to control others lives.
Wow!  How much did he win?	By brother won a scratch off sticker lottery ticket! He is giving most of it to charity.
That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.	He won like $40,000. He is a good man to give it all away to a good cause.
Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.	I was driving the other day and my gas tank was super low. I thought I could make it to school in time but decided that running out of gas was the bigger problem.
HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol	Yeah so true. The funny thing is as I was driving into the gas station my car started to stall because of having zero gas. lol
Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.	Very often I get very emotional when things go wrong. I think more emotional than most people.
I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much.	I know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but I just can't help it. Maybe I need a therapist.
Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!	I made a stupid mistake at work and I got fired. What am I going to do?
Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.	Yeah, I feel really bad though. It is such a terrible feeling to be rejected like that.
I hope everything is fine, How did it turn out?	My son was very sick a few weeks ago, enough that he had to go to the hospital! I was nervous about what the doctor would have to say but had faith that he would help my son get better.
Im happy to hear that, a sick child is always a scary thing.	It turned out fine in the end. I knew the doctor would do what he thought was best - and my son did get better!
Neat. Where are you going?	I am going on a trip next month and I'm really excited about it
Sounds exciting. Have fun.	We are driving to Florida to visit family. It will be a long drive but that's a part of the fun.
Oh wow, are you feeling super envious?	My friend just got a new car and it's the same car I've been wanting ever since it came out
Ha ha, I don't blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though.	You bet I am! I told him I was driving my car whenever we go out because I don't want to see it,lol.
I 'm glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it?	My dog has been really sick this past week but after going to the vet I truly think he will be just fine
I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.	He want really weak and had a fever. It was because of an allergy that gave him a severe skin infection.
Wow, that's so mean of them to laugh at you! At least someone pointed it out eventually, right?	at work I kept on hearing people laughing behind me, when I got to my desk, my coworker pointed out a postage stamp was stuck on back of my head
That's embarrasing. But hey, I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Don't beat yourself up for it.	yeah, but i think my boss even seen it too, i wanted to hide under my desk
Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.	My cousin has the perfect life, sometimes I am envious of her.
I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time	I do too, I just wish I had her life at times.
The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.	i applied for a job promotion. But i won't know if i got it or not until next week
Things like that make me antsy.	i know, im having trouble concentrating at work, I just want to know right now
A new haircut can do wonders! I always feel like a million bucks after.	After my haircut last week, I have received so many nice compliments!
I bet you looked great! Those compliments would've made me feel good too!	I wasn't too sure about it but all the lovely compliments really made me feel good!
Oh? What specifically were you talking to her about?	I was just reminiscing with my mother about my childhood.
Haha! Well, as we mature, we learn so much more about ourselves.	My aspirations when I was younger. We had a good laugh when I read in one of my old journals that I wanted to be a teacher when earlier that day I had stated that I couldn't imagine being a teacher now.
Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!	I went to Six FLags once with my daughters.   I didnt want to go as I hate to ride roller coasters and am scared of heights.
Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;)	I am a mother not a father silly.  Yes I made it through all right, but thought I was going to die!!   THey had me ride the ferris wheel and I was crying as they were laughing at me.
Oh no! So what did you do?!	Today before work when I went to brush my teeth, there was no toothpaste left. My boyfriend used it all!
That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath, right?	I was so angry, I had to leave for work very soon. I ended up just asking a neighbor to borrow some. I didn't have anytime to buy any before work. I couldn't afford to be late.
Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?	I once had a party when I was a teenager.  My parents were out of town.
Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.	Sure can!   Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol, so needless to say we were all drunk.   We attempted to play darts.   Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall.  THe house was trashed when my parents returned.  Years later I feel bad about it still.
Wow, cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?	i envy my sister, she is going on vacation in Paris
That's too bad. Well, at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.	I will be at work, maybe next time
That's amazing! How old is she?	My litthe sister read out the speech in my graduation party
Wow, that must've been a big thing for both of you.	she is 9
I am sorry I do not know what nclex is but I wish you good luck	I will be sitting for my nclex exam on friday
O ok I hope that everything works out for you	Its a nursing exam, thank you
Wow! Did you try to get it out?	One time there was a stray cat hiding from a dog in my front door
That's amazing! He probably loves you so much	Yup, I adopted it and he's my pet now!
Do you feel nice and refreshed though?	i was upset at myself for sleeping in so late this morning
I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!	yes definitely!
Oh no! Did it break?	I dropped my iPod touch on the bathroom floor.
Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.	Unfortunately yes. The screen shattered and I went for over a month without music.
Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?	My guinea pig was feeling very sick but I was able to nurse her back to health.
Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!	No, I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals. I just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies. She is alright now!
That is good, how long did it take before you go him to this point?	After training my dog I feel confident now that he can be around others dogs without fighting.
Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though	It took about a month. I think it was quicker but I was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out.
Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?	my next door neighbor just bought a Mercedes, I wish i can have one.
sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway.	really cannot afford one, but the neighbor can, he is always buying expensive stuff, last month he bought a speed boat.
Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment	Last week I had a argument with my son, he really said some mean things to me. I thought I raised him better.
well maybe you guys should talk	It really hurt my feelings. I wish he would've handled it better. I'm more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said.
Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.	My roommate cooked some really foul smelling meat last night, I had to leave or I was going to puke.
Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now	Exactly! I had to air out the place for a couple hours after.
Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is.	I used the restroom at a nice restaurant and I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe and didn't know it until I left.
Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol	Yeah, I wish someone told me at least. They all probably just laughed. Haha
I am with you, i like it a lot more than summer personally	I am probably one of the few people in the world that looks forward to winter coming.
I feel that, I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy.	I can get so much work done indoor and the beauty outside is wonderful. I love winter clothes and all the winter holidays.
I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.	When you took your driver's test were you nervous?
Did you pass the test?	I took mine last summer I was nervous also. My heat was racing the whole time. I was so anxious!
I am the same way, I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know	Sometimes I feel envious of those that have money than I do.
I think cities are more expensive, like living costs, so I do not want to live there ether personally	Yeah, and it seems so hard to make money these days, at least for me. Maybe I should move to the city where there are more opportunities.
I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.	i believed my friend would return my cell phone to me in time
Oh, I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?	i accidentally left it at his house and had to message him on facebook and ask him if he could drive it over
That is amazing!  I'm really happy for you!	I am as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow that I will get this job promotion!
It sounds like you really deserve it!	Thank you! I have worked so hard for so many years and finally it shows that someone paid attention. :)
that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?	Last week I almost got into a car accident, I was terrified.
at least your ok, thank god for that	I am but I still think about how things could've been so much different right now if I hadn't swerved just at the right moment.
Nice, for what position	there is an upcoming promotion at my job, I am sure i'm going to get it.
That's pretty great, you must really take the initiative.  Good job	as a supervisor. I feel that all of my hard work and skill has given me the inside track for this position
You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning, and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.	I have all my ingredients for my dinner party and now I am getting ready to prepare a feast!
"I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of ""rescue me"" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max"	Yeah, we all have different personalities. But you would come to a dinner party if invited, right?
Aw, that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.	I broke one of my mom's crystal figurine, I tried hard not to tell her but in the end I felt so bad I had to tell her.
Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.	Yes, she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though.
I am right there with you!  God is good and wow, He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.	I feel happy to know that God has got my back and I don't have to worry about anything.
Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!	Oh yes. He is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! He will never let us down. Even when we think He has we should only think it is something that I need to learn and He is so caring that He wants to teach me.
They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.	I miss how we all used to celebrate Christmas when I was a child. It was such a warm and cozy time. Things are really changing in this high tech modern world.
Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!	Yeah, so you remember all those wonderful old Christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between. I still have some videos of recordings from the 80's.
Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?	In July, I found a large moth inside a cottage that my brother and friends were staying at.
I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!	It was as big as a small bird, I was super surprised. It was furry and white all over. I caught it with a cup and let it outside so it can live on!
What is your nieces name?	My sister gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl last week! I was so happy to meet my niece.
That's amazing, was it your sisters first baby?	Amelia, she makes my heart so happy!
It will be amazing!  I should do that too!	I planted a whole bunch of flower bushes this year. I cannot wait until next spring when my entire garden will be in bloom with so many wonderful colors and smells.
That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!	Yes! I just went to the local nursery and they had so many plants to choose from. I made sure to only choose the ones that had some kind of fragrant smell. I am dreaming of all the flower arrangements I will make next year.
That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.	After feeling depressed for days, I took the time to sit outside in the sun and have a nice chit chat with my mom.
I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!	Thank you for your kind words, it means a lot really. And yeah the cool breeze felt so comforting, it completely changed my mood!
I imagine, are you prepared for it?	There may be a hurricane in my area soon I am kind of scared.
Oh yes, last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.	Not yet, but I will start preparing. I am worried we may lose power or our house may flood.
Aw, did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?	i felt nostalgiac going through old childhood belongings
That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.	yes definitely, it was great
I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.	i forgot to pay my credit card bill, I'm so disappointed with myself.
I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.	Yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things.  I hope they don't charge an overdraft fee.
That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?	i have a presentation tomorrow. I am ready for it.
Good luck! You will do great!	for the past two weeks I have bee working on it and this week I have been practicing it
Haha, I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.	I once called my girlfriend's mother mom by accident.
Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.	Exactly, especially since we were only dating for a few months! I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.
That's gross, why are they coming in?	The pigeons keep coming into the house a pooping all over the place!
You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.	Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.
I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you, it is very sad.	Oh, I am so sad that my family could not come and visit me. I miss them all so much. Why is life so busy for everyone these days?
Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.	Family should come first, right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up!
I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.	Recently I had a very good customer service experience with my cable company. Not only did they fix the problem they gifted me free premium content for a year!
I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!	That's so funny! I was so surprised too but really happy. I might even pay for the services when my free year is up.
Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?	My dog eats other animals poop. I have seen them eat goat, duck and cow poop. I hope they don't get sick.
I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious.	The vet says that this can be normal but to make sure that I give them their worm pills regularly.
Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!	Last night there was a terrible thunderstorm. I unplugged all my computers and electronics. Then there was a loud bang and I heard my electrical box make a loud click. I think my house was electrocuted!
That is a good lesson to learn early, I am glad everything turned out okay for you!	Yeah! I learned my lesson from experience. We get pretty crazy storms out here.
That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol	I cannot wait until the weekend is here! I'm going skydiving for the first time!
I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience	I am not nervous yet but I for sure will be when it's time to jump out of that plane! Oh, what am I getting myself into, lol.
Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry?	When I was a kid I used to steal candy from the local 7/11 with my brother. We never got caught from the store but my parents found all the wrappers hiding in our room.
Haha did they believe it?	Yes, they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy. We lied and said it was from a birthday party at school. Haha
nice, what system do you play on?	A friend borrowed some video games of mine
i really enjoy video games as well	Xbox primarily, I'm hoping he'll get everything back in one piece
That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?	I cannot stand my neighbor's dog's barking, its never ending
You might try contacting the authorities, though I don't know if it would help.	i have, that what makes me so mad, he just smiles at me while I tell him and he does not do anything about it
thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family	I found some of my old toys that I had passed down to my younger brother today while cleaning up his closet.
did he enjoy the toys>	It really was! It brought back so many wonderful and touching memories.
Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?	The first time my girlfriend invited me to her father's house, I was super anxious.
That is good! Are you guys close now>	He mostly speaks French, and although I understand it perfectly I have trouble speaking. In the end it went well, and he was super easy-going and made me feel like family.
Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?	I spent hours reviewing notes and course content to prepare myself for a few trials that a company wanted me to go through.
WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.	I felt super prepared and I ended up getting the job just last Thursday!
Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)	In a way yes and no. I'm teaching online, and my major in University is Education at the moment. So it helps me in school, and looks good on a CV for a full-time teacher position in an actual school someday in the future.
My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.	Thank you for appreciating teachers!
Man.. i need some of that luck!	My friend is so lucky, he always seems to be winning lotteries and gambles of sorts.
Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that	Same here. Just last week, he won over $400 playing slot machines, and I really wish that could've been me.
I agree! I wish I was able to make things	I really appreciate an artists talents. It is pretty incredible what beauty they can create!
For sure you are born with those types of talents!	It is really fun to create things, anyone can do it! But talent I think is a gift from God.
That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!	i was channel surfing and ran across the old Batman tv show, brought back memories.
I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day.	same here, I loved watching Batman as a kid and could not wait to get home from school to watch it.
that must have been embarrassing, I hope you weren't to traumatized	When I was a little girl I would have to wear shoes with holes in it to school. Everyone made fun of me all the time. My family could not afford much.
that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building	I think it is a good trauma cause to this day it keeps me working hard for my dreams so that I will never have to be in that place again.
Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.	i was sad to see my favorite tree had been broken in the storm last week
How big was it?	it was pretty bad but i think the tree was already dying
You shouldn't think about death whilst you're alive! Just live each day to the fullest.	I am very fearful of dying. I know it will come one day, I just hope and pray it doesn't hurt so bad.
Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it.	Yes you are right but it is hard to not think about it when there is so much death going on around the world and we have to hear about it through the media.
That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?	Last week I really had to rely on my friend to keep his word.
It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.	Yes in the end, he showed up and help me fix my car. I am really glad that he did.
Nice! I hope you get it, I'll cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?	next week I find out if i got the promotion at my job. I have my fingers crossed.
That's all you can do, but if you worked hard, I'm sure you will get it!	i do not know, i feel like i have done all I can to get it, but you never know
Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?	Last month cleaning out the attic I found a old box of photo albums that had belonged to my mother.
Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you.	So many good pictures. It was great reliving all of those old memories, many I had forgotten about.
Oh boy.  I've gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?	I just got a new haircut, lets say this, I do not like it.
That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back.	no, same style from my barber who always cuts my hair, for some reason he did a terrible job
Ohhhh, disgusting.  What did you do?	yesterday, i was drinking a glass of milk. When i put the glass back down, a fly was swimming in the milk
I bet, what a terrible feeling!	first i did not know what it was, than i realized it was a fly, i was about to throw up
Oh man, your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up.	i know, flies are filthy creatures  and plus they produce maggots, yuck
is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself?	i have to give a presentation on Monday, I don't think I'm ready
yeah i can understand that!! id want to get it over with too. the sooner the better	i think i'm ready but it is the waiting  to give it , I just want it to be over
Oh my, I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you.	A few of my co-workers said they'd be absent next week
Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!	Yeah, I hope we don't get a ton of work while they're gone
Yeah, flying can be scary.	I have to take a plane trip next week, I'm not looking forward to it and I have to take a plane trip next week, I'm not looking forward to it.
Hopefully it isn't a long flight.	i know, just the idea of being in a plane up in the sky, scares the bejesus out of me
thats awesome that you trust her	I left my young daughter with my friend. I totally trust her though, she will be a great mom someday!
its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays	yeah she is a great person.  she is a little younger than me.
Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?	One time my cat got ran over by a car
Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.	No, it was some person driving recklessly!
That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling.	Last year during the spring, our area got record rainfall. My basement ended up getting flooded and destroying many of my childhood things and keepsakes.
Yeah, I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things, but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them, I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch, because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.	It really is, it just sucks losing all of those things. They were like my connection to the past.
Oh man, thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.	I am at peace with myself after taking a nice hot shower
It's such a wonderful feeling, I should take a shower soon too.	Yes! I feel like a new person!
How did you you go over your budget?	what kind of saturday is this, i mean sure it's a relaxing one but damn i really blew it on the budget plan
I hope you can have better self-control in the future.	i spend it like maniac i am so disappointed in myself...
awww. that is good news!	I Really really can't wait! next week is the week! i finally get to see my love
how long has it been seen youve seen each other?	i know! i am so happy about this! and i really can't wait, we are going to go on a cable car too
Oh gosg. Do you have some greedy roommates or something?	i am just absolutely mind boggled, i just brought the coffee 3 days ago! and it's ALREADY FINISHED! WHAT
Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.	just greedy? more than that, who the hell finishes a whole 500g of coffee in 3 days !
yea i have	have you ever had that one person who never ever disappoints you?
thats great, happy for yo	me too, she's recently going through a lot and despite all that, she's working hard everyday for us and i am just so happy and lucky to have her
literally me right now actually	ever just feel so isolated in a room and alone? what a weird day
must be nice to have someone that loves you	same, it's just such a slow day too, but one thing that is making me hopeful is tht next week i am going to travel to see fiance
What is going on with your work?	...i am truly utterly worthless, i couldn't even submit my work on time
You can do better next time I believe in you!	i had an assignment to submit but i didn't submit it on time, i am so disappointed in myself
Ouch.  Why?	i am so looking forward to the day we pass from this world and go to heaven
Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.	because  i am a very faithful person and i trust in my god!
its not so bad, it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there	tomorrow is my first university day and i'm very nervous
once you figure the way it just becomes routine	i hope i won't get lost but i'm so bad with that, i always get lost.
You are so right, did you read that somewhere?	whenever you feel so hopeless, so distance and you feel like nothing ever matters, just remember to trust in the universe, for it has a plan for you
That is cool, have you studied any philosophy in school?	no, i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma
Yes, I feel that every day.	do you ever just feel so grateful that you're alive?
I wish people understood how precious life really is.	it's the most amazing feeling ever right? it feels like the universe gives us everything.
Why did you throw your laptop?	i threw my laptop the other day and i already regret it
Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.	because i was very pissed off, i wasn't able to work .
wow thats vivid, what game was this?	3-3, final game decides it all, final game till promotion, time ticking, palms sweating, final minute and just as we are about to win it all, to finally reach that noble masters rank, my team mate fails to make the correct decision and we lose, it all just crumbles to the ground like rocks falling from the sky, my dream gone
ah yes league, love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more	league of legends, my other addiction, other than my fiance
Oh no, I hope it wasn't an important meeting.	i was super late for my meeting on tuesday , i got so embarrassed
Sorry to hear that, were they understanding about it?	it was actually, and because of the traffic i couldn't make it
I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?	my wife has been very sick recently and i am making the soup that is famous with our family recipe and she is slowly getting better
That sounds quite delicious if I must say.	it's called lentil soup and we make it a special way with cumin spice and love
Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!	ever feel so full of emotions when looking at old pictures?
Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!	for me it's when you get more than just nostalgia, when you get sad, happy and sentimental
Yikes, that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.	i am just so scared of what is going to happen in the future, i need to make money, have a house, own a car, and other materialistic good because  i am a person of the 21st century and i cannot afford any of this so i need to get a job, but all these jobs are paying me next to nothing despite my masters degree in computer science, what to do?
Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.	ummm? excuse me? do you know people earn a lot from computer science, it is not my degree for sure, it's this corrupt world we live in that's the problem
Life is the most beautiful thing.	life is beautiful isn't it?
I live every day like it's my last.	are you happy with the way things are? i am enjoying every second
Waiting in line is the worst.	i hate when that happens, i was suppose to be the on who was first, who was suppose to go first in the line, but instead my friend ended up going first
I hope you got your classes.	but it was in the line for university classes, i am so jealous
Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!	i feel like there is nothing that i can't do, i feel so powerful!  and smart! i just implemented a kmeans algorithm with my own method
I agree that it is as well. In most situations, it can work to one's benefit.	yup i am !  so so confident and i think this is a good trait to have
I don't understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?	feelsbadman, some one in this absurd family ! WHO KEEPS ON TAKING MY BLOODY SHOES!
Why would they want to do that?	no, i am angry! imagine every morning you wake and someone in your family takes your shoes because they want to make you angry
I can imagine the flood of emotions.	it sure does bring back a lot of fond memories as you go for a walk past your old neighbourhood
I hope it was worth visiting.	yup, many memories from the past, the good, the bad
Sounds like you are prepared. I like the confident attitude. Go get them!	pen, check, notepad, check! i am going to kill this social event today! i am going to leave 30mins earlier too
I would love to come with you to yours. LOL, I just invited myself.	i'll sure do that, it's going to be fun too, do you go to social events?
I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.	i don't know how to feel, i've been working so hard the past few months but i feel like i am not getting anywhere, still at the same place as i was
Are you looking for a new job?	maybe, but i also need a plan because if i continue like this, i won't get anywhere for reals
That's not true I'm sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?	can i really do everything alone? i just feel so useless
I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online?	no, i don't like people, they make me lose more hope in the plane
ewww that's gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??	last week my friends and i ordered pizza while at their house, after an hour of eating the pizza i pucked everywhere on his couch, i feel so bad and grossed out
He seems like a good friend.	god knows what was in that pizza, but i helped clean and the mess was still showing, but he said it wasn't a problem
The future certainly can be scary.	... everything seems to be everywhere, i am just scared out of my mind of the future
I am curious for what the future holds.	are you not scared of the future?
Oh wow, the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?	my mother got a big cake and left it in the fridge for us to eat later, i selfishly took it all upstairs and closed my door and ate all of it while watching anime
If you can and have time, I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand.	she hasn't yet, we're suppose to have it later tonight, but how disappointed she'll be when she comes back from work and sees that the cake has been entirely devoured by me...
Oh cool.  How does it work?	i created this math formula yesterday for uniquely identifying words! and i am so happy with myself
Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.	it seperates the ascii values of each character and adds them up to give a number, then it divides  them by their length and then it does something else which i will keep a secret :P
Oh man, I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn?	i never got the chance to get promoted at work even though all my colleagues did!
I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!	i am envying them. i don't know , i'm working very hard as well.
That's good!  You're awesome!  Family is what is important	i care a lot about my family and always want them to be happy
I agree!	family should always come first.
ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?	i am very ready for my first semester in university!
yeah defiantly, my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done	i am really hoping i can make some good friends, and just learn about everything i don't know a lot about you know?
what? what happend? why are you angry?	i was very angry when i learned about what happened
really? was it about something very stupid?	i'm angry because my mom and my sister had a fight and they aren't talking together. that made me very mad.
I think that's a kind of natural reaction, especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged.	I play guitar as a hobby but rarely play in front of other guitarists.  I only feel comfortable doing it if the people around me play worse or not at all.
Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.	Exactly!  I always feel there's less chance of embarrassment if you're the best in the room.
that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?	i'm looking forward to next week, i'm going on a holiday with my fiance!
that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to	well, we are going to turkey! i've heard some good things about that country i'm very excited
That's awesome! It's so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.	i have a lot of hope for the future. i'm going to get married soon, and everything is going to be amazing!
I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.	isn't it? i don't see negative things in life, i try to always look at the bright side.
what did he do yolo?	i am sad because my brother failed me.
this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!	he couldn't keep his promise with me. he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn't and that made me sad.
Oh, yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too?	my brother was sick and he puked in front of me, it smelled horrible
that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.	i didn't, but no one was home and i had to clean that up :(
don't be! i know this is overused but trust me, it's not as hard as everyone else makes it to be, if you focus and aim for your goals, you will get it! i know you can do it!	i am moving out of this country soon and i'm worried about my university, because i'll have a lot of exams to do and not gonna lie i'm stressed out.
don't be, i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out	that was very needed , thank you so much, i was really stressed because of it.
It really is, what can we do to help?	global warming is terrifying me. and i'm scared people aren't even realising it.
That'd be a good idea, we could all start biking.	i don't know maybe starting by stop using all those cars ? i don't know i wish we could do something.
What was the project?1	i just delivered the best project at work!
You must be an expert on nutrition then!	the project that i worked on was to deliver a marketing speech for healthy eating
What are you looking forward too?	i am so hopeful for the future!
Which country? that sounds fun, are you guys doing anything fun there?	i am going to see my fiance who lives in adifferent country
yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items	i am travelling soon, but i am bringing with myself a lithium ion battery for phone replacement to the airport security, i am anticipating the security there so i may talk to the person at the desk to confirm i can take such an item
yes. hopefully all will go well	the website says yes! but my friends say they don't know if that's accurate so i think i need to double check once i am there
Are you his best man?	i am very happy, my best friend is getting married today
I hope he does, being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it.	well , i consider him my brother, i don't know if he thinks the same, we grew up together.
sounds quite interesting to code	at work i ended up writing code that is able to detect words that are similar and detect their meaning and cluster them into groups of n clusters
oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming	it sure is! i used genetic algorithm as well as k-means and neural netwroking
What happened?	i am nervous and scared of my feelings, i feel like in the future they will hurt me
I hope all goes well so you're as happy as possible.	nothing so far, but it's what migh thappen in the future
That's good! I hope you had a good time?	i saw one of my old friends today
Yes, it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time.	well it brought back a lot of memories, and it felt nice to see her after all those years.
What are you planning on doing with it?	so greatful to be given this wonderful life
That sounds so admirable, I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person.	build a life with my fiance and grow together and gain more and more knowledge
why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?	in my room, alone and i am starving
oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.	i have, but the wait is so real you know?
wow, spooky, what did you do next?	i saw a cat the other day it showed up out of nowhere i got really scared.
that must have startled you	i just walked past it.
You having money problems?	... starving once again, this feeling sucks, it gets me all depressed, nothing to eat and the delivery is 1 hour late
I don't think I've ever had a delivery guy be that late. I'd be mad.	yeah! but i still ordered but the food delivery isn't here yet
Oh, that stinks...literally! I have pets too so I know how you feel. My cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!	my cat really got on my nerves today! she pooped in the kitchen floor and that was the first thing i saw when i woke up
It is, I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!	it's the worst right?... really made me so so so mad
thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication	i am so proud of my fiancee, she's been working extra hard.
that does have to feel really good	and seeing her reaching her goals and growing so much makes me so happy.
Yes, where do you live?	I am very lucky that I live out in the country where the quality of life is so much better than living in the high stress cities
I love Colorado. I visit all the time.	I live in Colorado with the mountains and fresh air with so many wonderful outdoor activities available.
Yeah, we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!	Sometimes I feel very happy that I am a US resident. When I travel to other countries everyone is so amazed that I am from the US. They treat you very differently because they think that the US is so great, rich and free.
I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.	That is for sure! I just wish other countries were the same. There are so many people suffering all over the world.
That is great. Where are you selling your popsicle?	I am very happy that my popsicle business is finally thriving! I have worked so hard on it for many years.
I understand. Good luck.	From my house and from a few local stores. I am not ready to make it any bigger than that.
You were probably just being you.	I was so happy to come home the other day and everything was clean and dinner was already on the table. What did I do to deserve that?
Haha! That's usually the case. : )	No, I think somebody wants something... I am just waiting to hear it, lol.
I understand. Is your family living far from New York?	I lived in New York City for a couple of years and it is definitely a place where one can feel quite alone if you don't have family or friends.
It is always cool to have family and friends close by.	Yes, a plane ride away. But there was also a lot of cool things to see. I think it was a good experience but it would be better with friends and family.
That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!	When I am in nature I feel good that this world is exactly as it should be. Everything is moving along to Gods plans.
Why do cities make you feel that way?	Yes, when I am in nature. :) But when I come to the big cities I feel like it is the devils playgrounds
Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas.	feel so bad, I forgot again to fill the gas tank up in the car after I used it all. My friend is going to kill me!
You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her!	I just seem to forget until I get home. Oh well I will just have to give her some money again instead. Oh she is going to be angry.
Did you give it back or just walk away?	just got back from grocery shopping, The cashier gave me back $10 more change than I supposed to get
Yeah, that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.	i did not find out untill i got home, the store is kind of far and I think I'm going to keep it, but it's eating on my conscious because of that
I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place.	I feel a little weird about looking at this house for sale. It looks haunted and I think something bad happened there, but not sure.
Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it!	That is a good idea. It is such good deal and I think it would not need much money to fix it up. But a ghost in the house is definitely a deal breaker!
I'm sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don't get overwhelmed.	When bad things happen I get too emotional. I think more than other do. Sometimes I think I am crazy.
Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.	Yeah, I know. But in the moment it is hard. I guess I am just a very emotional person. Maybe I need theraoy, lol.
Maybe it isnt your body, but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from, but none the less it will happen!	I have faith that I will get pregnant soon. Why is it so hard? Isn't that what a women's body is built to do?
It's hard to trust anything, even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray.	Yeah, more people are having these issues these days. I think it may be true that someone may be poisoning us through the water and food or something! It is a scary world!
Thats kind of you, did everything go well when you put it back into the wild?	I found a lost baby duck. The mother was no where to be found. I brought it home and took care of it until it was big enough to be let loose again.
Sounds like it went well!	The duck flew away and was never to be found again. Hopefully he was reunited somehow with his family. I just hope so.
Yes, I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.	I feel so upset when other people tell such horrible lies about other people. Some people are just cruel and are only out for themselves.
I just ignore them. At some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working.	Yeah, it is very hurtful. But what can one do? Get back at them? It just seems like you would go to their level. I guess it is better to just swallow it and move on.
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better.	This past week my 3 year old son caught strep throat. I ended up having to miss the entire week at work to stay home with him.
It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.	He is, i hated missing work, but that the sort of thing a person has to do for their children.
Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right, my god. Bring extras next time? lol	My high heel broke in the cement the other morning and I had to wear them all day at work. Not a good day!
I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now.	Yeah, from now on I will have an extra pair in my desk. Everyone was teasing me all day. It was so annoying!
That's very sad, has he considered getting help for his addiction?	My father continuously gambles all his earnings away even though he has two minors to support.
I can certainly understand your feelings, I hope he can somehow fix his habits.	Nope, he doesn't care and denies it's an issue. When I found out, I was too angry to look at him.
Has it been a lot of fun?	My friends and I started playing Halo online recently.
Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood, such a great game.	Incredibly so. It brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the Xbox 360.
I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things, especially if you've partied before already.	I feel happy to just stay in and watch a movie at home on a Saturday night. I have no desire to go out and party like most people I know do.
That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.	Yeah, been there done that. I don't miss those hangovers on Sunday morning. Totally not worth it anymore.
Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?	Last month,finally, after years of working towards it, I was finally promoted into senior management at my job.
Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?	Yes it did, and much better benefits. Seems like I finally got to the end of a very long road.
I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!	After working for years at a job I didn't like, and struggling in school, I found a new job that coincides with my Major.
That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!	Thanks! For the first time in a long time, the future isn't looking so dark.
Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.	Last week at work, I went to sit down at my desk chair and completely missed it and fell straight into the floor.
Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.	Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.
Yea, I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.	I know I should not feel like this but I feel so envious when I drive through the rich neighborhoods and I know that I will never be able to live there.
Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.	I have to pass twice a day too. Oh well, I should just be grateful for what I have now. I just can't help that feeling from creeping in though. Maybe I will buy a lottery ticket, lol.
Oooh, how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?	Last month my wife and I ordered our first new car with a delivery time of six weeks.
I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!	We ordered a new Ford Superduty pickup. This six weeks is taking forever.
Indoors?	In the 6th grade, a bird pooped on my back during lunchtime.
In the 6th grade? Where is this school?	Nah we were having a barbecue outdoors.
Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.	In Quebec. All schools have a budget for extra-curricular activities and events. We had a barbecue once every year in June with free food.
How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.	That sounds awful, all schools need a budget for activities for the students. Anyways I had no replacement shirt and I had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; I felt sick.
Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either	Last month, a buddy of mine bought a scratch off ticket and won $4500. I never win anything when I buy them.
haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play	I mean I am happy for him and all, but I wouldn't mind some found money either.
Oh god, I am so sorry. Is he okay now?	Our puppy wiggled out of his leash. He ran toward the busy road and was hit by a car. It was awful
I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.	Sadly, no. He passed away at the vet a few hours later.
Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.	coincidence, I too I'm taking a trip but a business one, I 'm not looking forward to flying
Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.	a couple of time, but it truly scares me
You have to be more careful next time, maybe you need a calendar to remind you.	The other day I forgot to take my anti-anxiety medication.
I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.	I put an alarm on my phone, I just get so busy some mornings. At least it didn't affect me too bad until the next morning.
That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.	I am feeling pretty good after my interview for a promotion at work last week. My boss told me I nailed the interview.
Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.	Well I have almost twice the experience as the other two candidates, so I have a really good feeling about it.
That must have been a bit scary, You should have called the police.	The other night, drunk bicyclists were following me home and laughing on the sidewalk.
You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you.	I wasn't too far from my home so I figured I could tough it out. I was pretty scared however, especially since it was nighttime.
Okay! Now that is interested, I would love to see them.	NASA released some free space posters a couple of months back.
Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.	I think they have them up on their website, you should give them a look! I had them printed for a small fee and now they're up on my wall!
Free? That makes it even better, I will be getting me some posters.	"Yup. The poster files are free, you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa, Trappist-1e, Mars Explorers Wanted and ""We Need You"""
I hope so too. Thank you so much!	Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!
I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?	Yesterday I found a massive spider in my room.
I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.	It ran off somewhere and I couldn't find it, even though I moved most of my furniture. I'm a little scared.
Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?	There was a chance that it could rain on the day my best friends and I went camping.
That sounds like it was a lot of fun!	It barely did at night, but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! I'm so thankful that it didn't, because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip.
Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/	looks like we have something in common, when i walk through my house, the rooms are empty. There are no one here but me
Yeah i would get a pet	i know, i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable
That is so sweet of you. I love cats, you must be a caring spouse.	I was watching over my girlfriend's cat while she went away on a little trip.
The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.	I like to think so, thanks! Unfortunately, the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and I felt so isolated.
I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it	Ever since I started taking medication for anxiety and depression, I've been gaining weight.
Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle	I have, she said I'm okay because I still have a healthy weight. I've been a skinny boy all my life, and I still am but this extra chub has me feeling down.
Its a good guard dog then	No matter who comes to the door, my dog barks.
What kind of dog is he	In a way yes, but not really. As soon as anyone ENTERS the house, he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him. He's such a nuisance but I love him.
Animal accidents can be really bad!	I was driving down the highway when I saw a car in an accident. It seems they hit a cow! Oh my!
At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow.	I felt so bad for the poor cow. It seems no one was hurt except the cow. :( The car was pretty damaged though.
Just cherish the moments	my pet dog is getting older. I know one day she won't be around anymore
It will be okay	I will, but just the thought of it makes me blue
What kind of job is it	I put in a lot of effort and energy and I found a new job!
That is a nice job I am sure	It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself.
Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?	I came home drunk from the bar and stole my neighbor's package that was sitting out.
That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.	No, but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.
Awesome, congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift, is there a particular game you're eager to play?	With all the money I've been saving up, I should be able to purchase an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality system soon!
Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!	Hmm maybe Robo Recall, a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!
Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?	I went on a new bike trail the other day, it was super fun but also a little scary.
I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?	Yep, exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike, I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.
I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!	Absolutely! And now that I know it better, I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday, can't wait!
What kind of con was it	I made a new friend at a convention I was volunteering at. I was shocked.
that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that	Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime, Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).
That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?	I participated in a ropes course with my colleagues, we had to learn how to trust each other.
Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.	Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall, but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.
Why did you do tht?	I let my little sister go into my wallet and grab my credit card so she can order something online for herself.
That makes sense, you are a good older sibling!	She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.
I would imagine, that is a lot to drink!	I once drank six pints of beer in a night and ended up getting very sick.
I get that, well I hope you feel betternow!	It really is. I felt so bad about my actions, but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.
why is that?	I never learned how to ride a bike.
I get that, did your friends know how to ride bikes?	My parents never saw the importance I guess.
Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot	They did, but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.
Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?	My girlfriend made the cutest and most touching card for my birthday.
Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol	I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.
Oh, I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel...	My cat has terminal kidney failure. There's no cure.
Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.	It really sucks. It's fairly common in cats and I sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn't make it any easier. I'm sorry to hear about your dog.
Oh no,  what happened?	I received horrific news from a best friend recently.
That is terrible, you must have been devastated,  I hope he find the help he/she needs.	They had tried to commit suicide. It was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need.
Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.	you know at work, one of my coworker is always singing to himself, it bugs me
He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.	it really is, he thinks he knows how to sing, i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing
Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!	One time I slipped on a banana peel
I'm sorry but I probably would have, too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!	Yep, everyone was laughing at me
That is unfortunate, is he doing any chemotherapy ?	My neighbor was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad form of cancer.
Well I hope everything works out for him!	I'm not entirely sure of the regimen, I didn't want to ask too many questions. But I've been bringing pre-cooked meals over for her and her husband when I get a chance to help them out a little.
What were you waiting for!	One time I was waiting all day for the mail man to deliver my package
Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!	I was waiting for my computer monitor!
How well did it work out for you?	I ran out of laundry soap the other day, when I went to the store I grabbed a brand I hadn't used in many years.
Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!	Oh it worked fine, but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?
o no what did you do?	One time I saw my husband looking at another women
o no im not sure that was the best response	I slapped him and beat up the other women
Oh No! Did you get hurt?	I was leaving the bar the other day with my boyfriend and tripped on the step just outside the door.
I bet that was a little embarrassing.	Well, physically not so much, just a light scrape on my knee. But man my pride got wounded bad!
Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it	I was a cigarette smoker for nearly an entire decade. In retrospect this is slightly embarrassing.
That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!	Right. Not much that can be done about it now. I enjoy having more money now though for sure!
That is great to hear that things are going well for you.	Being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as I expected it to be. My daughter is awesome!
I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.	Thanks that means a lot to me!
How long has it been since the interview?	I was waiting to hear back about a potential job offer, I really wanted the job.
Oh well congrats and good job!	That's the thing, my anxiety and excitement started the moment I first talked to the company, it was driving me crazy. But I ended up getting the job!
Oh that is awesome for your friend!	My friend just won $500 in scratch-off lottery tickets!
Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.	Oh totally. I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious, I hate to admit.
That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?	I took on a challenging speed bike course recently that was above my skill level.
Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.	It actually worked out amazing! I knew going into it that I'd practiced a lot and had built up my skills, so I was sure I could do it even if I was a little hesitant.
That can be kind of scary. How did it go?	When I was interviewing for a promotion at my job. I did all I could to get ready for the interview.
Awesome, congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.	It went great. I having put in all the work ahead of time to get ready, I knew exactly how to answer the questions they had for me.
Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up	At my job a coworker took credit for a job I had completed. Once I found out, I went straight to my boss and got it straightened out.
For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it, most people dont'	I found them and gave them a piece of my mind. What kind of person does something like that.
Aww haha how many bags did you bring	We went camping this summer and my boyfriend made fun of me for packing so much stuff.
Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one	It honestly wasn't *that* much stuff, I packed it well. But the joke's on him, he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and I just so happened to pack one.
That sounds awful!	This couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night!
Have you tried talking to them about it?	Yeah, it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on, every single night? It's really ticking me off.
I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!	An actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! I didn't think they still exist.
I loved that too!	Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!
That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.	I am content with my life. I have nothing to complain about, luckily!
Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.	Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok!
Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you.	I was cleaning out the attic last week, and came across a box of old photo albums and some of my childhood things. I sat for hours just looking at old photos.
Did you share it with anyone else?	It really did. Seeing all those old faces I haven't seen for years. It was a great experience.
Nice, a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?	I recently applied for a job with a  new company. It would be such a step up for my family if I got it.
Well I hope you get it. Good luck!	Some, I did well in the interview. Just trying to keep spirits up while they make their decision.
That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?	I'm waiting to hear about a lucrative job opportunity, it would pretty much be my dream job.
I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.	Not sure, hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.
I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery	Most of the decisions that I made as a teenager were kind of embarrassing in retrospect.
Ha YOLOOO	I feel it. Most of the bad decisions were fun, at least.
I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season, too?	I can't wait until all the trees change colors and the weather starts getting cold. I love Autumn!
I don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall.	Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.
Awe, sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.	I worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed.
That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!	Well, not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.
I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?	The house is all cleaned and ready for my guests. Wow, I was cleaning all day!
I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.	Yes, there is no better satisfaction, in my opinion, than a clean house. :) My sister is visiting with her kids. They are staying for a week here at my house. I am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end.
That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?	My neighbor sits out on his balcony butt naked sometimes.
I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.	No but that might be a good idea. It's just an awkward and gross situation.
I certainly hope so,  Why do you want to move?	I have fixed up house to the best of my ability. I feel very certain that it will sell very quickly.
That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.	I am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier. Less house to clean and more time outside. :)
Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?	I feel confident that eating a fruitarian diet will give me more energy and happiness.
Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!	I have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life. There is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit..
Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?	I wrote an email to a family member I haven't spoken to in a long time and I wasn't sure how they'd take everything I said in it.
Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!	Yep, it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up!
Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun	I get so mad when the local kids throw eggs at the front doors of houses in my neighborhood. It is so infuriating!
Yup gotta lay down the law	Yeah! I wish I had the time for it! I am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act. I am going to teach them a lesson! But I love the paintball idea! That is great!
Terrifying! What was it?	I moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night.
Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?	It turned out to be the sump pump, I guess it was old. But yes, it scared the daylights out of me!
Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?	I made a really inappropriate joke about a coworker to some other people I work with and it got back to him.
That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.	No, but the person who told him confessed. So I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand. He actually wasn't that upset and appreciated that I owned up to it, but I still felt bad for it, mostly that I did it behind his back.
that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?	I got my work done early on Friday so I got to spend the day trying out a new bike trail on my new bike!
Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!	I've only recently started getting really into it. It sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really... satisfying. Calm.
How come you can't take them anymore?	I miss being able to take my children to the park.
Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!	they are all grown up.
That's intense. I hope you did well!	"I studied all night for my final exam"""
Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved	I did! I got an A and I am so proud and happy !
I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!	the neighbor's dog barked all night and kept me up, let's say I am not very happy right now
Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them	i understand the dog is being a dog, but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it
Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.	My cat somehow figured out how to open the cabinet and stole a bag of treats.
That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.	Right? I wasn't even mad about it, I was astounded by his ingenuity.
That is great! Hopefully he continues to be	I feel like my husband is the sweetest man in the world
Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even	I think he will. He puts up with me, and sometimes i can be a pill!
Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?	I was so upset when I had to put my dog down last month
I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.	Not really. She was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs. It was very sad.
That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?	During my first year in grad school, my basement apartment flooded. EVERYTHING was destroyed and I had to start over fresh.
Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you.	Thankfully, yes!! It took several months to replace everything that I could -- but even things, so many things I just simply couldn't replace.
Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!	I am in charge of booking meeting rooms for outside companies at my job. Last week, I made a big mistake and accidentally gave a group a room for free when they should've paid $100.
To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!	Thankfully, not too much! I was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and I managed to mess that one up so badly!
Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?	My brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight.
Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.	I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun, we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.
What was her reaction to that	I drank a lot and told my girlfriend that I would definitely sleep with her best friend if she was down to do so.
I am sure she will forgive you	She was a little sad and surprised, but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless, I felt very ashamed the next day.
That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time	My husband and I have been watching TV together each night--once the baby is asleep, of course.
Have you ever passed out together watching tv?	It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together, just us.
How old is your baby?	Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point!
And how long have you been married?	8 months old - but by looking at him, you'd think he was a two-year-old. Thanks for asking!
that is exciting! will it be your first house?	My wife and I found the perfect house for sale and we excited to put a bid in on it.
that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one	Well it would have been, but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.
You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?	I let my friend watch my dog last weekend.
Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?	It was good, he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!
Oh no, what did you do?	I once almost ruined my husband's master's thesis presentation--something he needed to pass to get his degree.
Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.	I started coughing--badly. He and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay. He was so distracted after that!
Lol that makes a lot of sense?	I was expecting a surprise birthday party today.
well that sounds fun!	Yeah I had a few hints. My expectations were somewhat true; my brother's friend celebrated not only my birthday party, but two other birthdays today. It was wonderful!
Haha caught red handed!	Last week while my wife were out for dinner at a restaurant, I got up to use the restroom and walked by the kitchen. I saw a cook pick up a piece of chicken off the floor and put it back on someone's plate.
Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service	We proceeded to leave the restaurant, but not after informing the manager, very loudly, about the incident.
Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.	I hope I do well when I start school soon, I can't help but think it will be too hard.
Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!	Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.
Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?	My husband's been searching for a professional job but can't seem to land one after interviewing.
That is a good news. I hope he get it.	Well, he has a masters degree and graduate certificate already. He's had a fourth interview for a position last Thursday -- so we are hoping this one will finally be the one!
Surgery on my kids always scares me but I have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young	Last month my son had to have surgery to have his tonsils removed.
I understand, when it comes to our kids and being worried about them it feels like time stand still	Yeah, I was terrified. I just wandering around the waiting room the entire time till they came and told me everything went fine. Seemed like it took days.
Oh for sure. I hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day	Isn't it nice when people bring you food, when you've had a long day?
Were at work today or doing something else?	Exactly! My boyfriend brought me dinner the other night. I had no groceries and just didn't feel like going out after a long stressful day. I was so thankful.
Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?	My little sister has been going all across the country this summer, spending lots of time on money on pop concert after pop concert.
Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.	Mostly I'm a bit frustrated that she's got so much money to blow on these concerts! And to travel all across the country!
Oh my gosh!  That had to be super scary!	During this past spring during a bad storm, we had a tornado touch down in my neighbors yard.
Yeah, thank god you are safe.  I don't know what I would have done if that happened to me.	It sounded like a train going by the house from the basement. Thankfully no one was hurt.
Yep I thinks its disrespectful and petty. What happened?	I don't like joining it when people talk about someone that's not there, just like what happened yesterday.
Thats good. I am amazed by people who think its okay to do that.	He was talking about my other friend who is a bit annoying sometimes. While I may agree I just don't like talking behind someones back.
Sounds like your co workers respect you then	I work at a library cataloging materials and am often asked to help my coworkers--it makes me feel like an expert, though I'm not.
Or that as well ha	They seem to. Or, at least, they know whom is the right person to go to for those specific kinds of questions!
Did you ever get caught?	When I was a young kid, I stole some comic books from the local grocery store.
Was she disappointed?	My mother found out and made me walk them back into the store and give them to the manager. That was a humbling experience.
How many month earlier he came?	When I went into labor with my son, it was quite the ordeal. He came before he was supposed to.
Is he healthy?	It was actually only a week--but he wasn't showing signs of being physically ready was the problem. Thankfully, I'd already had my bags packed for weeks so we went to the hospital ready!
whatwas the exam for?	One time I studied all night for my final exam!
tha is really cool what was your grade	It was for Organic Chemistry
What are they arguing about?	One of my coworkers has been arguing with his supervisor a LOT lately.
That's so ridiculous!	Everything and anything. It's annoying, though--he's not getting fired and is, in fact, getting more hours despite arguing all the time!
