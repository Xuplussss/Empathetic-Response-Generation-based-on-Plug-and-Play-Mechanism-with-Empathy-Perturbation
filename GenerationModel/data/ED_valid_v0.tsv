0.0 Today, as i was leaving for work in the morning, i had a tire burst in the middle of a busy road. That scared the hell out of me!	1.0 Are you fine now?
0.0 Yeah, i'm doing alright now, but with minor injuries.	1.0 Cool :) Is your car damaged a lot?
0.0 A few weeks ago, I was walking through my hallway, minding my own business, when all of a sudden a hand reached out from under a table and grabbed my ankle. I was so suprised. I thought i was got. Turns out, it was my son. 	1.0 That's funny, hope he didn't give you a heart attack.
0.0 I may have let out a scream that will have him question my manhood for the rest of our lives, lol. 	1.0 I would probably scream also.
0.0 I'm overly excited because will be flying outside the country for the first time tomorrow.".  Please enter here...	1.0 Wow! That sounds amazing. Where are you going? 
0.0 Traveling to South Africa then to Ghana. Also my first time visiting Africa	1.0 You are going to love it I am sure. Safe Travels! 
0.0 One time, I was holding my son over my head, when all of a sudden, he threw up all over my face. I almost cried.	1.0 Thats horrible, hope he is ok.
0.0 yeah, he had just drank a bottle, and I was moving him around like an airplane. In retrospect. I deserved it.	1.0 I see, glad he is ok.
0.0 Hello	1.0 Hi, how are you?
0.0 Im doing great i just wanted to tell you a short story about a time i helped an elderly lady.  She was struggling to carry her bags from a trip she had took.  I helped her carry them to her door ! Pretty good feeling when you help others 	1.0 That was kind of you, I am sure they appreciated that!
0.0 I went to the Kemah boardwalk with my boyfriend. It made me think of times I went vacationing with my family.	1.0 My last vacation went horribly wrongQ!
0.0 All I thought about was being at home again and being able to relive those moments.	1.0 Yes I love to reminice
0.0 My dog died a few years ago after I had my son.  It was right around Christmas and I had the dog for fourteen years.	1.0 Im sorry to hear that. I have never had a dog. What was your experience of the dog?
0.0 The dog was there with my throughout my life. He saw me through boyfriends and friends.	1.0 I am really sorry to hear that. What was the dogs name?
0.0 hello	1.0 Hello How are you and what is your story chat about today? 
0.0 I locked my keys in my car about a week ago. It was 95 degrees outside and I was at the store getting groceries.	1.0 OMG wow.... i hope you got it open quick! 
0.0 Hello	1.0 Hi, a few months ago, my mother found some stray dogs that were starving, so she told us about them. Of course, we brought the poor babies to our house, a mother dog and her two puppies. My heart went out to them, as their ribs were showing, but they were still so loving and sweet.
0.0 Oh no im so sorry to hear that :/ Thats good that you took them in 	1.0 Yes, I really felt so much sympathy for them and we all really liked them. We already had several pets, so I wasn't going to keep them, but I wanted to help them get better and find them a good home. We did for all of them, with the puppies being able to stay together.
0.0 I wanted to let you know recently i saw a younger man helping an old lady who fell to the ground. Its nice to see people helping others	1.0 That is really nice to see... I bet it made you feel good! So sweet. 
0.0 yeah it made me feel great :)	1.0 Nice to still see that behavior in todays world. :)
0.0 So this one time my grandmother gave me a scooter, it was the best gift ever, I was really happy	1.0 Thats sweet that you remember that, how old were you? 
0.0 I was around 10 years old I think, it was quite a long time ago for me now haha!	1.0 I wont make you reveal your age! lol :p 
0.0 I was extremely lucky when my girlfriend said she would date me, she is my world now.	1.0 That's wonderful. How long have you guys been dating?
0.0 We have been together for close to 5 months now, so not very long haha!	1.0 Time flies by pretty fast. Could be together 10 years from now!
0.0 I started a new job about a month ago and it's going really well.	1.0 congratualtions. what do you do?
0.0 I work in I.T. for the provincial government in Canada :)	1.0 oh wow. we're practically neighbors.
0.0 So my friend built a deck and it turned out amazing, I didn't know he had it in him.	1.0 How big was the deck?
0.0 I think its probably about 20 feet by 25 feet? I'm bad at guessing that kind of stuff hah	1.0 Wow that is big.
0.0 My girlfriends really quiet and she tends to scare me a lot.	1.0 What is scary about what she is doing? I'm not quite understanding what you mean.
0.0 Well, when shes dealing with her own personal issues she tends to kind of just vanish, I haven't talked to her in a few days and it's making me worry.	1.0 Oh wow, I can see why you're worrying. You should really talk to her about all this if she comes around soon.
0.0 I have to fill out forms all day so I scripted a program that does half of it for me and it works really well!	1.0 Thats great. Did you create the script?
0.0 Yeah, had to google a bit of it but it worked out well.	1.0 I love google. It is my favorite search engine.
0.0 I was extremely relieved when I found out my dad beat cancer.	1.0 Thats wonderful news! Its such a nasty disease! How long has he been clear? 
0.0 About 2 years now.	1.0 Well I hope he has 100 more years to go! :) 
0.0 My girlfriend hasn't talked to me in a few days and I'm struggling to keep it together but I am at the moment.	1.0 Have you tried to call her?
0.0 I have, but she's going through a rough time and likes to seclude herself.	1.0 Maybe give her space.
0.0 My grandma gave me a stone and said it was my birthstone and I hold it very close to my heart now.	1.0 What birthstone is it.
0.0 It is amethyst.	1.0 What birthstone is it?
0.0 I play some competitive video games and I think I'm pretty good at one of them.	1.0 I love to play Madden.
0.0 Do you play Madden often?	1.0 Yes, every day.
0.0 I haven't been able to talk to my girlfriend in a few days and it's making me quite sad.	1.0 Where is she?
0.0 She's in the same city as me, but she's going through a hard time and has decided to seclude herself so I can't reach her.	1.0 Just give her space.
0.0 My daughter is very smart. She learns things really quickly.	1.0 Thats great.
0.0 Yes, she picks up on things that I didn't even think she knew about.	1.0 Did you teach her?
0.0 I can't believe how big the waves are. Hurricane Chris amped up my summer.	1.0 Did you stay and ride it out? I bet it was quite a thing to see!
0.0 Yes, I've been surfing for ever. Only three of us in the water. 	1.0 That must be so much fun. I have never surfed but love to be on a boat. 
0.0 You are never to old to start. I'm teaching my mate and he is 70 I think. Hopefully I have a boat soon.'	1.0 Wow I hope I am fit enough at 70 to surf!
0.0 I usually hate to ask for help, so when my friends all surprised me by taking turns bringing us meals for 2 weeks after my 4th child was born I was blown away. I was so relieved to have help. 	1.0 Wow, 4 children my first is on the way and I'm freaking out. You must have great friends.  
0.0 That is so exciting, congratulations! We moved 17 hours away from family, so having a great group of friends is really important to us. 	1.0 Thank You. That is our next step we are moving from NYC to Miami after the baby. How can we find friends like yours? 
0.0 Get involved in something. Church, a social club for interests you are in. I don't recommend parent groups, for some reason they get really nasty. Just find a way to connect with people. Having children is so much harder without a support system!	1.0 I see what you mean about a parents group. I joined a dads group in facebook and it's full of people who complain non stop about  being an adult. 
0.0 I went to this thing called a Paint Night and I ended up making an okay looking painting	1.0 That sounds fun, I was never any good at painting
0.0 I am not either, but they had an instructor to follow along to! :)	1.0 That probably helps a good deal!
0.0 That Jerk, Did'nt even wave when he cut me off. 	1.0 I wish I had a rubber bumper to ram those people with!
0.0 After the Apocalypse I'll just ran them off the road. To make things worse he was in a Horse and Buggy. 	1.0 That is terrible, he could have hurt the horse!
0.0 So I got a new job recently, and I got my first paycheck and it was pretty good compared to what I was expecting!	1.0 Nice, congratulations. How are you liking the new job itself?
0.0 It's pretty good so far, I think I'm gonna like it for the long haul!	1.0 Awesome, I hope the job goes great for you!
0.0 When I was a little girl, our cat ran away and was gone so long we didn't think he would come home so we adopted another kitten. 	1.0 Thats sad, hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you
0.0 Well, we had a funny twist. The same day we brought the new kitten home, or old cat showed up. We kind of thought maybe he was hanging out close to home and was mad that we replaced him.	1.0 Haha thats crazy, I hope they became best friends, I love cats.
0.0 I really liked having my mom here. She helped with the kids but then when she left I missed it.	1.0 I can imagine! That extra set of hands -- and a person you can *trust* -- that's the best!
0.0 Yes, the kids really missed her when she left. It took us a while to get back to the normal around here.	1.0 Does she live far away? It sounds like maybe visits aren't too frequent.
0.0 This one time I spent an entire hour waiting for food at dennys.	1.0 An hour? Damn for somewhere as meh as Denny's that really isn't worth it.
0.0 Its really not, the foods not worth that long of a wait.	1.0 I haven't been there in so long for that exact reason.
0.0 I went to a nice work dinner with my husband. I can't get over how stupid I made myself look. 	1.0 Oh really? What happened that made you look bad?
0.0 I went to the bathroom real fast before we went into the dining room. I tucked my dress into my panty hose and didn't even notice. I walked past everyone with my underwear showing. I'm sure I'll laugh about it... someday. 	1.0 Oof yea that seems like it might take a few years or 10 before you can laugh at it but at least its over.
0.0 A lady was having issues with a program on her computer, and I solved it with no problems!	1.0 That's awesome! My experience was quite opposite as I sat waiting in the dentist chair for a 2 1/2 hour procedure!
0.0 That sounds unpleasant, did you get in afterwards?	1.0 Yes! I'm actually glad it's over :) So, how long did it take you to fix the computer problem?
0.0 I'm so angry they end up charging me 255 in charges that did not belong to me.  	1.0 Yeah, that is pretty annoying to have happen.
0.0 I called them and did not hold back. 	1.0 Good man! That is your money and they just wanna snatch from you.
0.0 My friend was telling me about teaching jobs to apply for. I didn't get hired, but she got one right off the bat!	1.0 It sounds like you're happy for her, which is commendable given you didn't get hired. Were you very disappointed?
0.0 I was kind of envious that she got the job and I didn't because it seemed like I was more qualified than she was.	1.0 That's always tough. It's so hard to tell what other factors come into play in situations like that. Are you happy where you're currently at, or still looking?
0.0 My girlfriend has some mental health issues and sometimes ends up in the hospital, and I go and see her as often as I can.	1.0 I'm so sorry about that. It sounds like you're doing your best to be supportive.
0.0 Thanks, I am definitely trying to be as supportive as I can, she's my world.	1.0 She's very lucky to have you. I wish you guys the best!
0.0 I love going to places that I explored and play at as a child. Every time I go, I always feel super nostalgic.	1.0 I am very nostalgic too, that must be a fun time!
0.0 Yes, until you realize that it was 20 years since you played there, and you start feeling old	1.0 That is true, but it is part of life, but it is cool to see things again, regain perspective
0.0 I hope this doesn't make me sound like a horrible boyfriend, but when my girlfriend first moved into my house, I felt very apprehensive towards the move at first. I was used to it being one way, and she was changing everything. Took some getting used to.	1.0 I'm sure it did! It's not easy to have to adapt to another person's habits.
0.0 I know. It caused some tension the first week or so. I had to take a deep breath, and realize its just things, and it was just me being reluctant to change. 	1.0 Yes, sometimes we have to learn to let go of the little things so we can appreciate the more important things. It sounds like you have done a great job!
0.0 I always hate thinking that my son is getting old. Just like a few days ago, I was looking at some of my sons old clothes, and it made me very sentimental. I never want him to get old on me. 	1.0 I believe you are really sad although it's a fact of life
0.0 Yes. You get to see them change and grow. It makes it all worth it. 	1.0 True, and the good thing is that when the kids grow, they provide moral support to parents.
0.0 I love a good surprise like anyone else; however, when my girlfriend waited until 8 pm on my birthday to tell me happy birthday and give me a present, I was caught off guard. I thought she had forgot. 	1.0 Maybe she did and remembered last minute. You should ask her!
0.0 She remembered but was trying to draw it out to make me think that she had forgot. I should have known because I made her wait until 10 pm on her birthday.	1.0 Next year I would just forget her birthday all together!
0.0 I work two full time jobs and he stays at home all day, Not Fair!	1.0 Is he a stay at home father, or does he just not want to work?
0.0 He's 20 he just wants to party and sleep.	1.0 I am sorry to hear that. Maybe as he gets older he will get his priorities in order and see how hard you work.
0.0 So the other day was my 23rd Birthday! I had no idea what my friends had planned but i walked into a room, a room which i thought was empty as the lights were all off, and all my friends jumped out and yelled happy birthday! It was such a shock, and felt so nice to have people who cared deeply about me provide me with such an experience! 	1.0 Must of been pretty surprised, Also great to have friends like that.
0.0 It really was! They even had my favorite kind of cake, chocolate mousse from my favorite bakery! 	1.0 That must of just made everything even better!
0.0 I'm thrilled. I got a raise!	1.0 That is a great news. You surely have done a great job.
0.0 Best Ever. I didn't have a clue I was going to get it. I just walked in and boom got a raise.	1.0 You are very lucky
0.0 Have you seen the film "within" on netflix? The other night my boyfriend and i watched it and I had trouble sleeping afterwards, it was pretty creepy!	1.0 No I haven't actually, I recently just canceled my netflix service! I have been thinking about resubscribing though. 
0.0 Why did you cancel your subscription? If you ever re-subscribe i would definetly recommend checking out "within"!	1.0 I could not find the content that was best suited for me personally to consider it worthy at the time, but if I do I will definitely check it out!
0.0 I spilt wed wine on my moms red carpet and blamed it on the cat	1.0 Was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet?
0.0 Very! It was a dark maroon stain. 	1.0 Oh! wow that must of been pretty obvious then.
0.0 My wife is angry and I don't know what to say. My anniversary was yesterday and I had no clue!	1.0 Argh! That's tough! Have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology? It can be easy to be defensive in those situations, which of course only makes it worse!
0.0 I'm still working on it. she has has not given me much of a chance. 	1.0 What's your approach? Does humor ever work....? You know, like wearing a dunce cap while holding a huge bouquet of flowers? Or going John Cusack and holding a boombox overhead, playing "your" song?
0.0 So the other night my boyfriend and I were out socializing at a networking event and another woman went up to him and touched his arm I coudn't help but feel a little envious even though he pulled away.	1.0 You should not be so insecure like that.
0.0 Its not about insecurity! 	1.0 What is about them? Do you think he is better than you?
0.0 Have you ever been to Las Vegas? 	1.0 yes, several times.The place is magical.
0.0 I'm actually going for the first time in my adult life this fall! I'm really excited!	1.0 Well, you are about to have the fun of your life, but gamble responsible.
0.0 I was thinking about my boyfriends wedding proposal the other night, it had left me in absolute shock. I did not expect him to get down on one knee and propose.	1.0 Why. Did you started dating recently or something
0.0 No we'd been dating a very long time but he was never the traditional kind. Never wanted an official ceremony but after meeting me i guess it all changed!	1.0 The most important thing is what you want.
0.0 I'm one of the best surfers that has ever hit the beach. I ride giants.	1.0 Really?? are you famous then? What is your name?
0.0 Yes, you can google me.	1.0 Are you still competing on a professional level?
0.0 I can't believe the bottom of the bag ripped and my wonderful taco's covered the ground. I'm sure my face was bright red with anger.	1.0 NOT THE TACOS!!!! Seriously, I can understand how frustrating that is. Especially when you have the taste for something.....then gone!
0.0 It's not like I could back in. I waited in line 20 minutes and had been looking forward to them all day. I had to skip lunch due to work being busy. I'm still mad.	1.0 Even worse. I'm so sorry. What did you do instead?
0.0 A bowl of dry cereal. 	1.0 Laughing *and* crying for you! Next time!
0.0 Text time I'm going to treat those sweet fatty taco's like the baby of Jesus. I get heated up just thinking of it.	1.0 I wish I could emoticon this whole thing.....a string of cry-laughing. I wish I could treat you to lunch there!
0.0 Have you ever participated in any races, half or full marathons? 	1.0 I have not! I used to run a lot for soccer practices. Have you?
0.0 I have not either! My best friend recently recovered from a broken leg and just completed her first full marathon, it was inspirational!	1.0 That's great for her. 
0.0 I am not afraid to admit this: I am 32 and afraid of the dark. The other day, my electricity went out due to a storm. It was dark, I couldn't find my phone or a light, so I screamed for my girlfriend to wake up. Am I embarrassed to say that, not at all, lol	1.0 hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark?
0.0 I am not scared of the dark. I am just scared of the things in the dark. And the ironic thing is, I don't even believe in the supernatural, so I am scared of the dark to just be scared of it, I think. 	1.0 OOO so you think something else is hiding in the dark and that's why your scared?
0.0 Before I applied at Inline I really did some background research on the company and what all they were involved in.	1.0 That's probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place. Were you happy with your results?
0.0 I was!  It ended up securing me the job because the company itself is small so the CEO and interviewer were really impressed..	1.0 Sometimes it's the extra step someone is willing to do that will make it. Good for you!
0.0 My husband hangs steel and the last time he had to go work in another state I felt really lost and alone for a bit.	1.0 I feel the same way when I'm away from my cat.  Does he have to travel a lot for work?
0.0 Sometimes he does.  Lately there hasn't been any local work so he has had to go out of state and its just too far to come back.	1.0 Maybe one day if you have the time, you can pay him a surprise visit.
0.0 I made it on time to the bus stop.	1.0 That is good. Where you running late
0.0 I was running late and so did the bus.	1.0 That sucks. I hate when I am running late I always feel behind
0.0 So I kind of ate the last piece of pizza that we had and I didn't know Tom wanted it... Feeling kinda bad.	1.0 I don't think you should feel bad, you didn't know!
0.0 Yeah but he just seemed so disappointed when he came home for lunch.	1.0 I'm sure he will be okay. Maybe you can make it up to him.
0.0 I should probably just buy him another pizza soon.	1.0 Sounds like a good idea.
0.0 I will start off saying I hate the water! I can't stand being in it; however, that changed last week when I took my son to his first pool. His joy erased all my hatred for water. 	1.0 Aw. Children will make us do things we NEVER thought we would (or could) do! 
0.0 Yes! I start swimming lessons next week. I have went 32 years without knowing how to swim, and that one visit changed all that. 	1.0 That is SO exciting! Congratulations! You are a fabulous role model for your son.
0.0 Oh today I heard one of Nannie's favorite songs on the radio.  It made me really miss our car rides together.  	1.0 Oh that's so sweet. My grandmother is a great person too and I'm glad to know her.
0.0 She was a lovely lady indeed!  I miss our time together a lot especially when I hear the music she used to listen to.	1.0 I think it's great that you have such positive memories of her, that way she'll always be there in some form.
0.0 Do you go visit some place that makes you miss growing up?	1.0 Yes, I love to visit the zoo!  
0.0 I recently went back to Michigan and got visit my old town and even the High school I had such great times back then.	1.0 What were some of your favorite things to do back in highschool?
0.0 My mother was always there for me when I was sick, annoyed and sad	1.0 That is wonderful!. It is always nice to have at least one good parent.
0.0 Well my dad too but my mum was so much more, even when I was naughty she was still there.	1.0 My mom was pretty awesome too! I'm glad you had a good one as well.
0.0 When I was little I got chased by a large dog and now that I'm much older the feeling is still the same. 	1.0 That is bad. Are you still afraid a lot?
0.0 I am, everytime I see a dog, I begin to run the other direction instantly	1.0 You need to fight your fear
0.0 I actually have no friends, can you believe that? I'm ok with it though.	1.0 wow that's very sad!  I am really sorry!
0.0 No, it's not sad. I really like to be alone, as i'm an introvert. I need my space.	1.0 Well I guess if that is something you enjoy.  I can't say that I have alot of friends.  Mostly my friends are family 
0.0 Do you ever find it hard to see at night when it's raining?	1.0 Yes I do actually, I was almost in an accident because of rain at night once. 
0.0 That's so scary! I am always on edge in those cases. I hydroplaned really bad last time.	1.0 I'm glad you were okay and nothing bad happened. 
0.0 I was eating at a restaurant and as I was leaving, an employee there gave me my phone which I had left behind	1.0 Oh that was so nice of them! I bet you were relieved!
0.0 I was, it saved me a lot of problems	1.0 I bet, losing your phone causes all kinds of stress!
0.0 I written down my notes on a double sided A4 paper, now I just have to wait for the exam which will begin in the next 5 minutes.	1.0 Okay that's good to know. Hopefully you pass the test and I hope you studied. 
0.0 Oh I did, I have been doing it for weeks!	1.0 Very nice man. Let me know your exam results when they're released! 
0.0 An employee who had not been working as long as me received a promotion	1.0 Oh no! I'll bet that made you feel terrible!
0.0 I definitely did not feel appreciated	1.0 I can see why not! I'm so sorry that happened to you.
0.0 When that happened to me, even the teacher couldn't stop herself from laughing. 	1.0 That is hilarious. I bet.
0.0 I was so awkward and quiet in school, how about yourself?	1.0 Oh my just the opposite LOL
0.0 I can't wait to December when my first born arrives into the world. I'm going to make sure they have a great life.	1.0 Oh wow! Congratulations! That is wonderful.
0.0 Thanks I'm stressed, excited and hopeful for the future. Do you have kids?	1.0 I do not yet but hope to one day. I think you will be a great parent! 
0.0 I was just speaking with my buddy. He is very over wight and somehow finished a marathon last weekend. Impressive!	1.0 wow yes it is 
0.0 I couldn't believe it. Just the day before we were crushing cheese steaks.	1.0 He probably stored that up for his energy for the race
0.0 My friend stayed awake for 36 hours studying for the MCAT! 	1.0 Haha oh wow, how was that for them
0.0 she did well actually, i was impressed with how well she managed to do despite lack of sleep!	1.0 Thats great, im glad she did well
0.0 I was commuting to work and a driver cut me off	1.0 I hate it when that happens! were you ok?
0.0 I made it out ok, just so irritating	1.0 I always wonder what goes through peoples heads when that happens.
0.0 I was busy due to work and visited my family for the first time in awhile	1.0 That sounds nice! DId you have fun
0.0 It was great, felt refreshing to be around them	1.0 I'm glad you enjoyed yourself, it is important to make time for family.
0.0 I get so annoyed with people who say one thing and do something else. My boss is one of those people. I wish there was just instance that I could be like this is where he annoyed me, but that isn't the case. It happens every day. 	1.0 I'm sorry to hear you're having to deal with that
0.0 Yeah, it can get annoying at times. I just stir clear of him when he is around. 	1.0 Sounds like the best thing to do honestly
0.0 I have an 8 hour shift in the office today but i can't wait to go home to see my boyfriend! 	1.0 you will survive, and you have something to look forward to
0.0 exactly, it's keeping me going since i'm not feeling to good today!	1.0 i hope your work day goes by fast
0.0 When I was 12, I got ran over by a truck. I was with my older cousin and his car messed up. Since he was my hero, I listened to everything he said, so when he told me to get the truck rolling and jump in. I listened. however, my 12 year old legs didn't make it and got trapped under the truck	1.0 Oh wow that is so scary.  I can't believe he asked someone so young to do that.
0.0 Well, he was 17 at the time, so in his defense, he just was being a "dumb teenager". My parents never let me go with him again after that though. 	1.0 I really hope you didn't have any lasting effects from the injury?
0.0 I only got a B- on an assignment i worked really hard on recently, but i'm working even harder now studying to ace the exam! 	1.0 Wow! I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you will get an A this time?
0.0  I do actually! 	1.0 Congratulations! Studying can be hard, but sometimes it's about technique rather than time spent. Are you doing anything different this time?
0.0 I was inspecting rooms yesterday when I bent down to look under a bed, I felt the back of my pants tear. The hole was the entire back of my pants. 	1.0 Oh no! I'm so sorry! I hate when that happens!
0.0 Yes, I have a staff of 30 and I think each one saw me at some point in the day. I have Khaki's on. I had to tape and staple the hole. 	1.0 Ugh! That's the worst! Too bad you couldn't run home and change!
0.0 I had to compose myself and pull over to remove the spider. I'm so thankful that I didn't freak out and crash the car.	1.0 Oh that sounds so scary!
0.0 It was very scary, i'm terrified of spiders. What are you afraid of?	1.0 I hate snakes! They are like little evil creatures.
0.0 So as I've gotten older over the last 10 years. I gained 30 pounds. My wife has me on a diet but every night when she goes to bed I have a bowl of ice cream. 	1.0 Don't even tlak about diets.I miss the times i was young and could eat all i wanted
0.0 yea but those times are behind us. Tonight for dinner was a Kale salad. It was gross but I've gotten a dish or rocky road with my name on it later. I do feel bad for lying to her but I need it.	1.0 Ugh.So boring.What wrong with being fat.At least they are all happy.
0.0 Did you ever attend college? I just completed my bachelor's degree and I'm feeling really good about my future!	1.0 Yes, I have an Associate's in Nursing.
0.0 Wow that's great you must enjoy helping others! 	1.0 Yes, it's been a great career.  How exciting for you to be about yours.  Congratulations!
0.0 Have you ever felt sandpaper on your bottom? Because that is what the new recycled toilet paper my wife want's us to use feels like. 	1.0 Holy smokes! Let me guess, better for the environment?
0.0 yes but in the end it's still paper and still going to the same place. I dream of the day I can enjoy Angel Soft or Charmin again.	1.0 You poor soul! I'm all for saving the planet, but you have to draw the line somewhere. I hope you get some relief!
0.0 I scored a 95 on my promotion exam, I was upset that I missed one question.	1.0 But that is an awesome grade!  You should be so proud!!!
0.0 Thank you, I am definitely proud! When was your last exam?	1.0 Oh, it's been years since I've taken an exam!  Perhaps the last one was a para-pro exam to help out in the local schools when my kids were younger - but they didn't even give me the grade - it was a pass/fail type exam (the horror of not knowing the grade though!!)
0.0 On the way from work I hit 155 in my VW on the Autobahn. I was well impressed with the car.	1.0 I love the Autobahn.
0.0 I've been faster in my old Audi but this little car is a 4 cylinder and still super fast.	1.0 Yes I use to own an Audio.
0.0 Last weekend I did something big. I finished my first 125 mile Iron man race. I'm still pumped.	1.0 I have never done that, good job.
0.0 That's it was a bucket list item and the hardest thing I have ever done but now I want to do it again.	1.0 You should. When is the next one.
0.0 Last night I was looking at my things I have in a storage locker and found a tub filled with my grandfathers things. The good memories came flooding back.	1.0 Oh wow thats cool.
0.0 Yes, he's been gone 10 years but I still think of him daily. It's strange how someone can make such an impact on someone for so long. 	1.0 Thats good you still think of him.
0.0 I went to a school for massage therapy, but I was worried at first that it would be strange to massage people I didn't know. 	1.0 Thats cool. Was it hard?
0.0 Some of it was. I had to learn the name, attachment point, and action of every muscle in the body. There are over 800. 	1.0 Wow that is a lot.
0.0 I think I get it from my mom. She would never open the door for uninvited guests.	1.0 What do you get from your mom?
0.0 Being bothered by uninvited guests	1.0 I don't like uninvited guests either! So annoying!
0.0 My first dog was a dalmatian. We adopted her and then went right to a soccer game before I even had time to play with her. 	1.0 I love dalmatians.
0.0 She was a great dog! That game felt so so long though. I had to watch her sitting with my parents while I played. 	1.0 How old was she.
0.0 I have a friend who is always complaining. She always has to make it sound like her life is harder than everyone else's. 	1.0 Well maybe it is but it could also just be she's spoiled.
0.0 I didn't know her when she was young, so she could be. I think she just likes to be miserable. 	1.0 Does she have like some other issues like mentally?
0.0 Have you ever put a pair of shoes on your feet that felt so sweet that made your sole happy?	1.0 I have a pair of fuzzy slippers that make me feel pretty cozy and happy in.
0.0 yea, I had that but recently my shoes wore out and they no longer make them. I'm so sad!	1.0 That is the worse, you finally find a brand and fit that perfect and they discontinue making them that is the worst, happens to me all the time.
0.0 Yes, I was angry and sad.	1.0 So did you end up finding a shoe that you could live with and that was close to the ones you had, or have you been unsuccessful?
0.0 I was on lunch and my coworker made me laugh. I pee'ed my self. I felt like I wanted to die.	1.0 Wow, did they notice?
0.0 yep, to make it worse I'm the boss. I'm pregnant so I tried to pass it off like the baby was pressing on my bladder. 	1.0 They will forget about it soon.
0.0 Becasue of a certain person who worked at the corner grocery I became uneasy to shop there.	1.0 I am so sorry to hear that. What did they do to make you feel uncomfortable going there?
0.0 They were a friend and customer of mine in a small business and cheated me out of a large sum of money.	1.0 That's the worst! You think you can trust people, and then they stab you in the back. I don't blame you for not wanting to see them again.
0.0 I just found out my new insurance is going to cover my big dental surgery coming up. No more bad jibbers!	1.0 That is great. That should be good insurance. Are you generaly happy with it?
0.0 Yes, they are covering $4, 500 worth of work. I only have to pay $100 total. I can't wait to have good teeth. 	1.0 That is nice. Good luck with the sugery.
0.0 I have a solo trip coming up. I'm going to Colorado to climb Mt. Elbert Solo. It's the tallest mountain in the united states.	1.0 I love Colorado, my favorite state.
0.0 Yes me two. I used to live in Colorado. I have not been up a mountain that big in years, I'm getting the belly butterfly's. 	1.0 I wish I could live there.
0.0 Last weekend I was on a date with a wonderful guy but right after dinner I got bad gas.	1.0 Did you fart?
0.0 It sounded like trumpets were filling the room. He looked like he wanted to puke each and ever time. 	1.0 Did they smell?
0.0 We had a hail storm about a month ago. It ruined our roof so we are trying to find a good roofing company to replace it. 	1.0 Did anyone get hurt?
0.0 No, thank goodness. Just a lot of car and property damage in the area. 	1.0 Thats good, as long as no one got hurt.
0.0 My husband just ran a Marathon. He had no training I was blown away by him. True inspiration! 	1.0 No training at all!  Wow, that's pretty impressive.  How far is a marathon?
0.0 26.2 miles. He walks about 10 miles a day at work so that's some training sorta.	1.0 That's still pretty impressive.  I bet he was proud of himself also!  Does he plan to do it again and will you maybe do it with him?
0.0 He wants to do an Iron Man. 126.2 miles, running, biking and swimming.	1.0 WOW - he certainly is adventurous and determined.  I bet he will do amazing.
0.0 I don't like saying this, and this is the first time I have but a few days ago I drove by my ex-wife and mine house, and for a few seconds it made me nostalgic. 	1.0 Wow you are brave.
0.0 Yes, it was only a fleeting moment but it was there. 	1.0 I bet you drove fast.
0.0 I'm going skydiving this weekend. I'm afraid of heights and freaking out a little.	1.0 Oh my! That sounds exciting for sure! I couldn't do it, I don't think.
0.0 Yea, until this morning when I called and put down a deposit I did not think I could either.	1.0 Have you ever done anything else so frightening?
0.0 Yes, I love doing something crazy and the feeling I get from it. 	1.0 I would say that you're an adventurous person. Me, I'm more laid back and mellow. Kudos to you and have fun!
0.0 Can you believe that I learned to ride a bike at age 15?	1.0 At least you did it. Lance Armstrong did not learn until he was 13.
0.0 Really? I didn't know that. Is there anything that you'd say you were a late bloomer for?	1.0 Love, it took me 12 years with the same person to build up the courage to ask her to marry me. 
0.0 Well congratulations for taking your time, look at it that way.	1.0 yes not if I can just calm the nerves for this skydiving trip.
0.0 Maybe try controlled breathing exercises, I'm sure you'll be fine and want to do it again.	1.0 Hope so. I don't do well with heights.
0.0 I had a huge exam that like 25 percent of my grade. I study for 2 weeks for it	1.0 Oh, I bet that was very stressful and difficult. I hope you did well on it?
0.0 Yeah because the professor got mad that the book store didn't have the little blue books to write in, so he canceled it and said whatever our current grade was to bump it up a letter grade	1.0 Well, at least you didn't go down in your grade. But, it wasn't right to treat the students like that!
0.0 As i get older I've fully accepted who I am. I'm not here to impress. It makes life easier when you think like this.	1.0 That is good, how old are you?
0.0 33 so not super old or super young. Just happy with who I am.	1.0 I am 31 so same generation.
0.0 Got a pizza last night. It gave me food poison. Now I'm stilling here sick and angry.	1.0 Oh gosh, I am sorry. Did you let the pizza place know? 
0.0 Yes, I called and they laughed at me. Told me it was the new pizza buy and that he must have used old cheese or something. 	1.0 Wow! In that instance, I would prefer them to lie to me than to laugh and be like I knowingly fed you bad food. 
0.0 I had studied for an exam for several days, so I was confident when I strolled into class because I knew I would ace it	1.0 and did you knock it out of the park? 
0.0 Uh, I made a B on it, so it was a false sense of confidence, lol	1.0 Perhaps be less cocky next time? Either way B's get degree's. 
0.0 When my son was 5 years old, he had to have his tonsils taken out. I thought it would be nothing, but when they went to take him back, I got so anxious. 	1.0 Was he okay? I've never heard of that going wrong.
0.0 Yeah, he was fine, but I had read a few horror stories online. I knew I shouldn't, but I did. 	1.0 That's where you went wrong lol. I'm glad he was fine. I would've been scared if it were one of my kids too. Surgery is still surgery.
0.0 My neighbors are still doing fireworks every night around midnight. Scares my dogs and they can't sleep through it. 	1.0 Oh, I bet that could be frightening for your dogs. Did you try to complain to them?
0.0 We don't know them well, but if they do it again tonight we probably will. I understand on the 4th and even a couple of days after, but some people have to get up for work. 	1.0 I think they have some leftover fireworks that they don't want to sit on. They should just use them next time.
0.0 My dog had bone cancer and we had to put her down. It was a very sad, but necessary decision. 	1.0 it takes a strong and compassionate person to make that kind of decision.
0.0 It was very hard, but she was suffering. Our vet was very helpful and we did ask him if he thought it was too soon. He assured us that it was not. 	1.0 She had a happy life. I'm sure she understands.
0.0 My mom is here visiting me and my family. It has been a really fun visit. 	1.0 Sounds nice. How long has it been since you've seen her?
0.0 About seven months. Too long. 	1.0 Oh wow. That is a long time. Do you live far apart?
0.0 We had a really great guest speaker at work today.	1.0 That's awesome! What did they talk about?
0.0 He was a retired FBI agent who talked about his experiences in the field in the 1970's.	1.0 Fascinating! What kind of work do you do?
0.0 I'm a role player that trains law enforcement by acting as victims or suspects.	1.0 Sounds like it was very exciting!
0.0 I am a bit Breaking Bad fan and love Better Call Saul. Season 4 starts in August. 	1.0 Me too! I also Iike staying home all day.
0.0 I wonder what will happen this season. I'm expecting it to be really nail biting. 	1.0 I have more time to watch movies and shows on netflix alot. I stay home with my little one year old during the day.
0.0 I came home today and someone had eaten my leftovers. I was so irritated!	1.0 I hate when that happens!  I look forward to those all day you know!  Did you find out who the culprit was?
0.0 Yes, it was my partner. He owes me big time	1.0 I think that calls for a nice steak dinner out - on his dime!
0.0 I got into some serious financial troubles a few years back.	1.0 It happens to everyone, are you out of it now?
0.0 yeah but what I did was terrible. I was self employed and I manipulated the system so I received money I was not owed/. My husband helped me out of the jam once I came clean about aht I did.	1.0 Oh well, it was nice to have someone to help you.
0.0 Do you like fair rides? I can't take them myself.	1.0 I don't like them at all. I've seen too many videos on the internet where people get injured or they break easily
0.0 Yes, I remember in 2007 a teen was decapitated at Six Flags in Atlanta.	1.0 Yeah that is terrifying. The smaller country fairs are worse. I bet they have no one really checking up on them except the carney folk.
0.0 I just don't think they're safe enough, many rides at the small carnivals are rickety and wobbly.	1.0 yeah, and the people in charge don't get paid enough to always check up and repair them
0.0 Two years ago, I discovered that my now ex-wife was cheating on me with someone she worked with. When I first discovered it, i was angry and hurt.	1.0 I bet you were, I did that to my husband when I was young. I thought it was the solution to relief from abuse.
0.0 I know it was a horrible experience at the time, now I think its the greatest thing to ever happen to me. Sleeping in different beds for 3 years isn't healthy. It took that to wake me up	1.0 I guess that was what you call a temporary situation. Sometimes moving on is required.
0.0 I wish I could go back to the 80's for a little while at times. 	1.0 Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
0.0 That's nothing but the truth! What's your favorite era?	1.0 Don't you wish you knew you were living in the good ol days while your going through them
0.0 Do you have a favorite era?	1.0 Probably the mid to late 90s. This is going to be hilarious but my one memory from that era is when I first heard Brittany Spears hit me baby one more time song. It changed my life
0.0 Did you graduate high school? It's a lot harder than most people think.	1.0 Sure I did! It takes determation to succeed
0.0 I didn't think I woudl have to do that much studying. I figured that came later in college. 	1.0 So if not by studying , what else?
0.0 I hit my toe on the edge of the doorway and it bent backwards. I was furious and crying at the same time!	1.0 That must have hurt a lot.Did you go to the hospital? 
0.0 No, I don't have insurance. Just like when I twisted my ankle on the stairs and fell. It took months to heal, but it healed.	1.0 You are very accident prone.You should get an insurance right away.
0.0 Sometimes we can get a phone call that shakes us to the core.	1.0 That is so true. And sometimes that phone call can be a trip of a life time!
0.0 My phone call was my mom telling me my 32 year old had just died of a heart attack while at her house.	1.0 Oh my goodness! Once things settle down I will give you the info about our cruise. It will help you relax like it did me!
0.0 I can't believe my husband planned this all by himself! My mind is still blown by this!	1.0 Sounds so exciting. What did he plan?
0.0 We are going to Mexico. I have mixed feelings, but mostly excited!	1.0 When and how? Are you flying or driving? Just because or is it your anniversary?
0.0 Don't you hate when you have to give stuff away and then can't? Well, that happened to me recently. I was going to give away some of my son's old toys, but started looking at then and realized that I need to keep them for no other reason than that I was being sentimental 	1.0 That's too funny. You know, I'm the exact same way.. I get so nostalgic with my old things. Can never throw them away!
0.0 I know! I am always like I need this notebook that has my 3rd grade handwriting back from the 90s because it will be very useful someday... lol	1.0 Yes, someday... Haha. I love looking back at those kinds of things. It brings back so many good memories. Such a good feeling
0.0 I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago, and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?
0.0 Yes, we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town, so it allowed me to get really close with her.	1.0 That's sweet, I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!
0.0 I was frozen in fear at the gym Monday, when a guy started seizing. He got so violent and ran away from paramedics.	1.0 Wow, that must have been challenging for everyone! Was he okay ultimately? Was someone able to help him?
0.0 They couldn't capture him, he jumped the fence by the pool and rolled down a hill. I don't know what happened to him.	1.0 That IS frightening! Hopefully nothing you'll have to deal with again!
0.0 Yes, I was surprise on how he changed to another talk	1.0 What was the initial talk?
0.0 I should descript how I could feel when am lonely	1.0 So how do you feel when lonely?
0.0 It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!	1.0 Maybe she does not have the hots for you anymore.
0.0 It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great, and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!	1.0 yes, i understood the first time.
0.0 I slipped on a puddle in the mall once. I was so embarrassed that I pretended I was hurt badly.	1.0 I know the feeling. Once I fell in high school from a puddle and laughed it off even though I was hurt, 
0.0 Even animals get embarrassed, I've seen it in my cats.	1.0 Oh really? I haven't seen that in an animal as of yet. That's pretty interesting.
0.0 Yes, my cat fell from the mantle above the fireplace and looked totally embarrassed.	1.0 Oh dang, talk about a fall! If I were your cat I'd be embarrassed too! Lol
0.0 One day my girlfriend told me about a guy that works with her and she mentioned how hilarious he was which then made me think of a meme that i read about how funny guys will make you laugh and then all of a sudden you don't have clothes on. It was only for a split second but it happened	1.0 That is a hilarious intro, thank you for that! So were you worried that your girlfriend found someone else humorous? (And you're very insightful + intelligent if you say yes! Though being both of those things, you have nothing to worry about ;-))
0.0 Well, I most def want to be insightful and intelligent, so I will say YES. I know I had nothing to worry about, but it is crazy how in those instances when you least expect it a ridiculous meme shots into your brain and you start playing "Along Came Polly" sceneros in your head. 	1.0 These references are perfect. And your girlfriend must enjoy you very much. Mazel tov, you crazy kids!
0.0 Lately, my two year old boy has been so much into wearing dresses and playing with babie dolls, i don't even want to think of i	1.0 Is that good or bad? Why the concern?
0.0 I think it is bad	1.0 OK why do you think so?
0.0 It is such a privilege to be able to help someone in any way you can.	1.0 Indeed. It makes you feel good when you can help somebody else with their problem
0.0 It also makes me feel bad when i'm unable to help.	1.0 I think if everybody in the world offered a hand of help to one another, we would not have much problem
0.0 My math teacher told the class I needed to do better on my next test.	1.0 Well you should try to study more and see what happens
0.0 I did, I can't remember, I either made an A or a B in there.	1.0 Well maybe you should talk about getting a tutor or somethinf
0.0 Well, this isn't going to make me sound like the manliest individual ever, but I think I need to tell it to someone. A few weeks ago, I was driving home from work. It was late. i was tired. So I wasn't my usual self. I was singing along to some song when all of a sudden I glanced up and saw two eyes looking back at me, and at the time I didn't know whos eyes they were so I was scared to death. I slammed on my breaks, in the middle of the road, jumped out, and was ready to run... I mean fight whoever was in my back seat. Long story short, I saw my own reflection in the mirror. 	1.0 THAT IS TERRIFYING. Until the end of your story.. then I laughed so hard I cried. But that is so relatable. I've been terrified of my own shadow more than once.
0.0 It seems to happen to me at least once a week. If I watch a scary movie or show then it happens at least every other day until I forget about it, lol	1.0 That's hilarious, But I also feel bad for you. Perhaps there is a way to calm yourself down after you watch a scary movie?
0.0 I have gotten better. I don't have to sleep in my parents bed anymore. Granted, I am 32 now, lol	1.0 Haha hey I would sneak into my parents bed even as a teenager when I was scared, especially during storms.
0.0 Why no response?	1.0 I'm supposed to wait for you to start. :) 
0.0 Is my response not good enough?	1.0 You haven't said anything yet other than asking why I hadn't responded. Sorry I'm a little lost as to what I was supposed to respond to?
0.0 It is really hot here most of the year.	1.0 Really?  Where do you live at?
0.0 Alabama. It's winter for about 2 weeks.	1.0 I feel your pain.  I live in Orlando, Florida.  So Im in the same boat.
0.0 Ok I was in Walmart buying a video game when this dud eshows up and immediately questions my selection. Like it's some kind of internet forum!	1.0 That is so annoying.Who he thinks he is???
0.0 I dunno, but I just said "That's great, bro" and left.  Then he follows me to the checkout counter to continue giving me crap about it.	1.0 I would be scared of a guy like that.
0.0 This was several years back. I was single, but I also like watching The Notebook type of movie, so i thought it would be okay to go watch The Vow alone. Wrong! Horrible mistake. It was a tear jerker, and I had no one there to see it and be like awe. All those tears wasted for nothing! lol	1.0 Aww... sorry to hear that. I haven't personally seen the show. What hit you the most?
0.0 Oh, it was a movie about a woman who lost her memory, and her husband had to get her to fall back in love with him. At the time, I was like I want that; however, now that I am in a relationship, I am like I don't know about this. I wish she would get amnesia as well	1.0 Sounds like a touching but sad story. Love without two ways interaction is really hard. I can't imagine myself going through relationship like this honestly..
0.0 I was joyful because my grandad shared the gospel with me when I was 11.	1.0 You mean nostalgic?
0.0 I guess I am nostalgic now.	1.0 What your grand father did to you was very special.
0.0 Can you believe that my neighbors downstairs allow their dog to relieve itself in the street?	1.0 That is not very considerate or respectful, plus the dog could get hurt if a vehicle were traveling down the street.
0.0 That's what i'm afraid of as well! But the dog seems to only want to use it that way. Do you like your neighbors?	1.0 I live in the country, so I do not have neighbors that live close. 
0.0 How fortunate, my grandparents lived in the country. I would always be scared at night thinking of their scary stories. 	1.0 I sometimes get freaked out, but getting freaked out every now and then is better than having to deal with neighbors. 
0.0 That's true. You can live in peace.	1.0 Yes. Peace is key.
0.0 I regret drinking way too much soda. Now my teeth look bad.	1.0 Uhmmnn! Cut down on the intake 
0.0 I quit. Probably going to need some fillings.	1.0 You need to see a dentist then
0.0 Have you ever felt really annoyed at yourself?	1.0 Just all the time.Who does not?
0.0 Yeah right now I dont know how to make a game install on another drive. Do you?	1.0 It depends on the machine you are working on.
0.0 This is a silly story, but it reminds me how confident teenagers can be. When I got my first tattoo, for some reason, it gave me this false sense of confidence. I am not sure why other than at the time I thought my tribal tattoo was something to admire	1.0 Do you have a tribal tattoo. How does it look like?
0.0 I got it when I was 18. I didn't take care of it, so now it looks like a shady prison tattoo, lol	1.0 That was bad. You can try some tattoo removal tool
0.0 A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink, but I didnt have any cash, so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something	1.0 Did you know them well? You must be very trusting.
0.0 A co-worker at work needed some money for a drink, but I didnt have any cash, so I let them have my debit card to go buy them something	1.0 I think I would have just said I didn't have any cash and let that be the end of it.
0.0 I never expected to fail my final exams, that is a major blow for me.	1.0 Sorry! Try harder next time!
0.0 Yeah, i know, i ought to have taken my studies seriously.	1.0 Never late you know!
0.0 Am surprised there is no response from my friend.	1.0 That sucks. Are they mad or what?
0.0 Sucks? I don't know about sucks.	1.0 It's kinda annoying to me when people don't call you back.
0.0 I was scared when I was in a wreck.	1.0 Serious? Why are you scared when you are in a wreck?
0.0 I was on an overpass and didn't want to fall off.	1.0 Wow, you really have to be careful dear.
0.0 Have you ever felt really ashamed?	1.0 Yes I have, it feels really bad when it happens.
0.0 Yeah same. Sometimes I can make a fool of myself by trying to act too smart or something like that.	1.0 Yea it can be quite embarrassing to look back on.
0.0 My younger brother always get the best dates and beautiful girls to date, i hate it.	1.0 Come on, you do not have to be jealous of your brother
0.0 I can't handle that very well. I need to get my groove and swag on. Damn it!	1.0 You can learnt some skills from your brother. Maybe it will help
0.0 It's high time i get my self a girlfriend, i feel so bored up	1.0 Are you trying to go out and meet some ladies 
0.0 Yeah, i'm so ready to date.I want to meet my person.	1.0 That is the first step. What you have to do next is be at your best behavior always 
0.0 I really feel like depressed sometimes when I realize how bad my tech skills are.	1.0 Do you work in the tech industry? You could always take a class.
0.0 That's true. There's a lot of stuff online. No I'm completing college for a natural sciences degree lol.	1.0 There's ton's online, and knowing more about computers can really help any profession.
0.0 I don't like it when people talk with their mouth full of food	1.0 I am sure it is something disgusting. Do you have someone do it around you
0.0 Yeah, i close friend of mine likes doing that. she has to stop.	1.0 You can just let him know you are not comfortable with it
0.0 I saw an article of someone I went to high school with who was working with an Ebola patient?	1.0 yes the patient is very ill
0.0 It was cool cause her dad died of cancer, so now she is helping sick people.	1.0 oh that is really a bad news i heared
0.0 hi	1.0 What is it that you would like to share with me? I am very interested to hear about it!
0.0 I am excited I bought a lottery ticket today and the jackpot is over 20 million 	1.0 Whoa, I hope you win! You never know, it could be your lucky day!
0.0 I have never been ready like this for an exam in my entire life.	1.0 I know how you feel, I get so scared when exams come up, its so hard sometimes
0.0 Open book exams can be tricky, i have no option but to pass this exam.	1.0 Yea open book make you think you dont need to study but that isnt true at all

0.0 Hello! I recently read an article about medical marijuana now being allowed in the united kingdom, What do you think about it?	1.0 I think that is wonderful, it's about time more countries and states are making this medicine an option.
0.0 the way it ended up being legalized, IMO, was a complete disgrace, they confiscated some childs weed who was epileptic, and as a result - predictably - he immediately started having seizured without it. Like gee, well done on torturing the kid! Do you think it was right to confiscate it, even though it technically wasnt legal at the time?	1.0 No, but as Mark Twain once said, the law is an ass. 
0.0 what an excellent quote 	1.0 I'm glad they made the right decision eventually though. It's about time!

0.0 I studied all night and I still flunked my math test. I can't believe it!	1.0 Did you study hard?

0.0 I was thinking about my old neighborhood	1.0 Memories.. what state? 
0.0 Can't say, but I was mostly just thinking about the friends I had there growing up	1.0 I understand but memories are always nice. 
0.0 I needed to use my car to drive somewhere, but couldn't	1.0 What happened with your car then?
0.0 My car was hit while parked	1.0 Ugh! that stinks! Did you found out who did it?
0.0 I was at a Journey concert with my son and he had to go to the bathroom while they were switching out performers. 	1.0 I would love that show
0.0 It was a very good show, but the people were so rude. We had to squeeze through a crazy crowd and didn't make it to the bathroom in time.	1.0 Oh well, it happens
0.0 i am suffering from severe fever for the past two days i don't have any energy 	1.0 Have you been to the doctor?
0.0 yes i had. he prescribed medicine for curing 	1.0 You will be fine then
0.0 Sometimes I'm surprised my son is actually my son. He currently has enough merit aid to pay for 2/3 of his college tuition!	1.0 Well that is quite the accomplishment. 
0.0 It is certainly much better than I was ever able to do.  I think my scholarship was $500 and I had no merit aide.  He set his academic bar high... I just told him to do his best.	1.0 He sounds like he has a great head on his shoulder. You must have taught him well.
0.0 I now have a new boss, and today was my first day of a leadership meeting with him.  You never know how you will be received.	1.0 Oh man, that's so nerve-wracking. Do you think you guys will be a good fit?
0.0 He spent some time laying out his beliefs and his expectations, and I have to say, I agreed with all but one of them.  That's pretty good.  He spent a lot of time watching the rest of us interact with each other, so I think he is trying to feel us out without making judgments yet.	1.0 Then it sounds like at least he has some perspective and ability to know not to overreact. I guess you could say you lucked out, but that may be me speaking too prematurely
0.0 My mother will be 85 in a few days. My sister planned a surprise party knowing the day, hour and location would be very difficult for me to attend.	1.0 I hope you make it. Thats a big birthday.
0.0 It is day after tomorrow and I am still not certain I can work it out. Sometimes people are very inconsiderate.	1.0 That not good. Maybe she will understand if you just can't make it.
0.0 My cousin just called with the craziest story. She and her family are locked inside a cemetery.	1.0 Wow... That would be one of my worst fears. How did they even manage to do that?
0.0 They had gone to a fair and decided to stop on their way home and walk around. I guess her husband lost track of time. The worst thing is they haven't eaten anything since about noon.	1.0 Wow! Any way they can get out? Did they call someone?
0.0 You hope your teens make the right choices, but sometimes even the right choices feel wrong.  He is choosing to be away with friends and not at home much.  I believe this is healthy, but I can help but want something different.	1.0 I know it is hard to start letting go, but it gets easier with time.  Don't worry, you are not alone.
0.0 That's what my own mother says.  In fact, she said my dad had a harder time than she did when I called and said, "Hey, I'm staying the night at so and so's, be back tomorrow."  I guess I will survive!  Hopefully he will choose to spend time here as he hits his 20s!	1.0 Yeah, they always seem to come back!  You just have to love them from afar for  a while.
0.0 I witness a great sight. I saw a gas station attendant leave his post to pump gas for a lady who has a hard time getting around.	1.0 That's really sweet. We don't have gas station attendants here. But that's nice that they're that helpful.
0.0 The one I refer to is more like a cashier. He is supposed to stay in a little shack and collect money and turn the pumps on. The lady offered him a tip and he wouldn't take it.	1.0 Ohh, that makes sense. Yeah, then that's really nice of them! And really sweet of her to offer a tip. I guess there's good in the world after all.
0.0 I have been fortunate to live a good life but I found a lump in my neck.  Most people would get it checked out immediately.  I waited.  I was scared to get the news.	1.0 I would absolutely be scared too. Good news or bad, I would be a worried wreck beforehand. Have you gotten it checked out yet?
0.0 I finally went to an ENT doctor in May.  They biopsied it, and that was the most nerve-wracking five days I have ever waited.  It WAS good news, but still had to have removed.	1.0 I'm so glad to hear it was good news, though!
0.0 Even when life is tough and seems very unfair I have done my best to care for my family.	1.0 Thats great of you. Life is VERY unfair but we can go at any minute, so cherish those you love!
0.0 It can be difficult. But I learned early on retaliating helps nothing.	1.0 It doesn't help us no. But you must take care of yourself too- Take some time for yourself when being a caregiver ok!
0.0 I am off work for a month in the summer, but I today was my first day back, and it felt great to be back on a routine!	1.0 Coming back to work could be good after a break.
0.0 A month is a great break to "get away from the daily grind" but believe me, at the end of week one you think oh, I have all the time in the world, and you aren't as productive.	1.0 I understand
0.0 I still can't believe I did that. My power had been off and I didn't even realize it.	1.0 That isn't good.
0.0 I arrived at church just as everyone was leaving. Boy did I feel awkward	1.0 Did anyone help you?
0.0 When I was pregnant, I thought so much about what my son would make me feel!	1.0 I wish I could feel that feeling, (unfortunately, I am a man). What did you end up naming your son?
0.0 I named him George, men can have feelings of their sons too. Hopefully one day you will as well.	1.0 I am greatly looking towards starting a family with my wife as well. George is such a nice name.
0.0 Have you ever been hospitalized? It's not much fun. I had a mini stroke and was stuck there for a few days.	1.0 I have - but not for anything that severe. Are you suffering any side effects of the stroke?
0.0 I am 99% me  The hardest part of the hospitalization was at the end of the day when my last visitor would go home. I am not good at being alone.	1.0 Yup - I know that feeling. And it's always so hard falling asleep in those uncomfortable beds with an IV in your arm.
0.0 I have a full time job that doesn't pay anything.	1.0 That really sucks man. Are you planning on looking for a new one?
0.0 I love my job, it involves my five year old kid and my eighty year old grandma.	1.0 Well, as long as you're doing something you enjoy, that's all that really matters.
0.0 I have a table that is somewhat unsteady, I put my computer on there because I have no where else to put it. 	1.0 Have you figured out what's the problem?
0.0 I have not, it seems to do ok except when my son puts his foot on there even though I tell him repeatedly not to do that!	1.0 Sounds like maybe one of the legs on the table is bent? 
0.0 My 2 year old daughter keeps picking up random words lately.	1.0 Yes? thats so cute, but you have to be carefull not to say bad words in fron of them
0.0 I know!  She said the f word!	1.0 OMG, well it is a bad thing but now you can be more polite in front of them, and also when you are not with them!
0.0 I went to a concert last weekend and saved the tickets.	1.0 Are you keeping it as a souvenir?
0.0 I am, I plan to scrapbook it once I get the pictures back.	1.0 Nice, I do that sometimes with movie tickets if it's a great movie that I enjoed a lot.
0.0 We recently went camping.  Everyone definitely gets closer in such close quarters!	1.0 I've been camping a few times - the proximity to others makes me feel stuffy too. Where do you usually go?
0.0 We went by a lake.  I accidentally opened the bathroom door with someone in it!	1.0 Oh wow! I bet the person inside would've pooped his pants, but there was probably none left!
0.0 This Spring has really made me appreciate family.	1.0 What happened?? Did you guys went camping or something?
0.0 My grandmother fell ill, and passed away.	1.0 Ho, I am sorry to hear that.
0.0 I got a notification on my phone that I had a package delivered and went to look for it	1.0 Too late I already took it. Just kidding, did you find it?
0.0 I did, they left it sitting in the middle of the driveway so it could get run over!	1.0 Oh, that's bad. Was there anything important in it?
0.0 My son and wife are coming for a visit. Been a long time since I have seen them	1.0 Wao thats so cool you must so excited, how long has it been?
0.0 about a year. I am on the east coast and they moved out west	1.0 Wao it must be very difficult to be separated from your wife and son, sorry
0.0 I went to a hockey game with my five year old son earlier this year. I had to bring lots of supplies!	1.0 Oh yeah? Do you have to do that every game?
0.0 When I have my son with us I do! My husband was shocked when he said he wanted his blanket and I pulled one out of my purse!	1.0 Thats funny. Well at least it sounds like you are always prepared. 
0.0 I have been married for ten years. Since we aren't swingers, I'm a one man kinda lady.	1.0 That's cool. I am not a swinger either.
0.0 Staying with the same guy day in and day out over a long period of time can be tough.	1.0 How did you do it?
0.0 After a full year of trying to get a leak fixed, I got help from a neighbor's roofer, who "knew a guy."  He said the guy didn't work on roofs, so I was confused!	1.0 That makes no sense.
0.0 Exactly!  The roofer told me that since I replaced my roof and the leak was still there, the problem had to be my fireplace chimney.  He said stone chimneys often develop leaks.  As it turns out, this chimney guy fabricates a type of gutter for chimneys to keep the water from running down the rock.  For $300 he made and installed the "gutter" on site, and I have had NO leaks!	1.0 That seems like a good price.
0.0 its so hot here. i've had to shower like 3-4 times a day cause you start sweating anyway and it feels icky. Hows the temperature at your place?	1.0 right now it's freezing in my home lol I just got out of bed after 30 mins of sitting because it's coold
0.0 what? where the hell do you live? what do you mean its freezing? oh my god i am so jealous	1.0 haha i live in virginia where right now the temperture outside is muggy 85 degress just regular ac pumping in my home
0.0 ooooh you have an AC, thats why. I live in europe and AC's...arent a thing at all, only the occasional pharmacy will have an AC	1.0 aw man that must suck how do you huys keep cool through the summer
0.0 Oops. I meant I was upset when my dog died.	1.0 I'm sorry, How long has it been?
0.0 Happened in Febuary.	1.0 That's always a tragedy.
0.0 Last week, my girlfriend invited me to meet her parents. The whole time I was on edge because I wanted to make a good impression.	1.0 That's nerve wracking for sure.  How did it go?
0.0 Well we had dinner and the whole time a was stuttering because her father was asking very personal questions, but I think they liked me.	1.0 It probably went well, despite the common jokes most parents want their child to date someone good so try to look for the best in people.
0.0 We love going on our annual family camping trip, and just got back from it!	1.0 Oh nice! How long did you guys stay?
0.0 We went for a week, but did have to come back to town once.	1.0 Oh no, What happened?
0.0 I really love being in the great outdoors with my family!	1.0 Oh yea? Where are you guys? In the mountains? Camping?
0.0 We went camping, yes.  We're in the Midwest, so no mountains, unfortunately.  But we were near a lake.	1.0 Lakes are awesome. A body of water around here is pretty far. How long are you guys staying?
0.0 I did well on a project for a company	1.0 Did you get anything extra, like a bonus or a trip.
0.0 I think I might get promoted based on the work	1.0 Great. What business is it?
0.0 I was on my way home when a car drove through a huge puddle near the sidewalk	1.0 I can tell where this is going.
0.0 I got completely drenched, it was terrible	1.0 That has never happened to me. Thank god!
0.0 I am a stay at home mom. School just started.	1.0 Well does that make you anxious?
0.0 It does, this is my only child and he is going to kindergarten.	1.0 Oh, that would be rough. I've been through that too.
0.0 A close friend of mine has to leave the state for work	1.0 Are you happy for him?
0.0 Kind of, it's going to be sad since I won't see him again most likely	1.0 But if is a great opportunity for him, you should be happy.
0.0 A friend was able to fix a problem I was having	1.0 That's very nice of the friend. What sort of problem was it?
0.0 Computer problem.  It was something I couldn't figure out on my own	1.0 Bah, those newfangled computers. It's nice to have a tech saavy friend.
0.0 My coworkers sometimes put more work on me than necessary.	1.0 Why do you think they do that?
0.0 They don't want to talk on the phone and can get away with it for a while.	1.0 That's not fair and probably very frustrating for you. You need to say something to them.
0.0 I moved to tornado alley a few years ago. I'm not used to large tornadoes so I was pretty scared when it started storming.	1.0 Oh man, I can't even imagine. I lived in Kansas for a while and we had a storm that did a lot of damage. Took out the power all day and stuff. Nature can be so devastating sometimes.
0.0 We aren't too far south of Kansas in Oklahoma. We have had to spend a few evenings in the storm shelter. I guess stuff can be replaced. 	1.0 Jeeeze, yea, it's totally understandable to be afraid. Has it been good there otherwise?
0.0 I love it here, except for the tornadoes and snakes. 	1.0 It's awesome to hear that! I guess no place can ever be perfect though. Here's hoping we both can live long, happy, and fulfilling lives!
0.0 I can't believe I spent 2 hours in the car just to arrive to surf and no waves to be seen. 	1.0 That must be so disappointing. Is there something else you can do to have fun?
0.0 Kiteboard but I left half the gear at home. The surf report said 10 foot waves and it's flat water. Not cool bro, not cool	1.0 Sounds like you really like the water. So what do you do now?
0.0 In 6 days I leave for Peru	1.0 Wow! I've never been anywhere near there.
0.0 It's a surf trip. They have monster waves. I'm nervous. 	1.0 I've been to the ocean a few times but I've never even seen a surfer. We had a small boogie board.
0.0 Do you live inland? 	1.0 I live in Tennessee
0.0 I've been river surfing in Tennessee. You have some decent white water rivers that offer boating and also surfing.	1.0 Wow. I must have a boring life then, because I have only seen tug boats and barges on the Mississippi.
0.0 Every single morning one lady on my team comes into my office and cry's	1.0 Oh no! How come?
0.0 You guess is as good as mine. She's crazy. Today she was stressed. Mind you she is 22 lives at home and has no bills.	1.0 Oh well maybe she has a lot of problems internally. You never know how someone's home life is like.
0.0 She did mention this morning that her doctor said she needs meds or locked up. 	1.0 Aw well it's likely bipolar- I know a phew. They have a hard time even on meds. 
0.0 I can't decide how to spend the $100. I found next to my car this morning. 	1.0 I would save some and maybe get something you need/want?
0.0 Don't really need anything but it was a great way to start the day.	1.0 For sure! Any extra money is always good!
0.0 I can't I went out with my ex's best friend while we were dating. I was a jerk but it was Karma biting her in the butt.	1.0 Had she done that to you before?
0.0 Right before that I found out she was seeing other people while I was in Iraq.	1.0 What a shame! 
0.0 Yea, it worked out for the best. A few months after that I meet my wife and we have been together for 11 years now. First baby is on the way in December. 	1.0 Congratulations!
0.0 Got on the scale this morning. Thanks to work stress I lost 15 pounds.	1.0 Oh man! I wish work stress would make me lose weight lol. I gain! Are you looking for a new job?
0.0 Yes, that or a new boss. I love my job but my boss is terrible.	1.0 Oh I don't deal with that well. I hope you get a new boss!
0.0 I can see the kid's car from here. He is 16 and has a car work 100k	1.0 Wow, what brand
0.0 Bmw 8 series. It's my neighbors kid. 	1.0 That is a nice car
0.0 Do you see a man and that yea he's got it going on?	1.0 Yeah all the time. I get so jealous
0.0 Yea well I lost 25 pounds and now i'm that guy. Happy in my skin. 	1.0 Wow, that is hard to do. Congratulations my dude!
0.0 Last time I climbed Elbert I started getting sick from altitude. Heading to Colorado next week to try to climb it again. 	1.0 That sounds awesome!  Is Elbert a fourteener?
0.0 Yes, it's the tallest in Colorado. This will be my 3rd time climbing it. But the first time since I got old and Lazy. 	1.0 Hahaha.  Well, I hope you don't get sick.  Take something salty with you, maybe that will help.  Have fun!
0.0 Aced my Real Estate Exam today. Now I'm licensed in two states.	1.0 Congratulations. I bet you're happy!
0.0 Yea, time to advance my career now.	1.0 Do you work for a company or on your own?
0.0 I'm self employed but new to the business.	1.0 Cool beans
0.0 I was recently waiting to hear from my old apartment about my security deposit refund. I needed the money to pay my new pet deposit, and wasn't sure if I'd get enough money back.	1.0 Were you able to get it back?
0.0 I was, and I ended up getting enough to pay the deposit and then some.	1.0 That's great! I bet that was a relief.
0.0 I was watching a video about a man who made a small table out of chocolate. It looked real and was just amazing. 	1.0 Wow, that should have been amazing
0.0 It really was. It also made me want to eat chocolate. 	1.0 Me too, I love chocolate
0.0 I was so happy to watch my friend do a backflip	1.0 I've always been too scared to do a backflip. I always worry I'm going to break my neck or something. Did it take him a long time to get it right?And did he get hurt?
0.0 I think he just took gymnastics classes. He luckily did not get hurt!	1.0 Oh, that makes sense. And I'm glad to hear that. I always worry about that sort of thing. You ever think about trying to do it netx?
0.0 I hope the next doctor's appt. that I have goes well. Sometimes they aren't the greatest experience. 	1.0 Are you sick?
0.0 Yeah, I have health problems, it's complicated. 	1.0 That sucks, I will pray for you.
0.0 I can't believe I walked in on someone using the restroom. 	1.0 Oh my, that must've been an embarrassing situation!
0.0 It was! I knocked first and no one answered, so I thought it was okay to go in. 	1.0 That's ok, you did the right thing. It probably happens to lots of people.
0.0 So remember I told you, that I've lost my phone for a moment on a subway?	1.0 Yes, what about it?
0.0 So i guess I just dropped it, and a very old man, picked it up and gave it back to me	1.0 That was nice of him.
0.0 I woke up today to a bit of a strange sight.	1.0 Tell me all about it.
0.0 Well, it was still dark and too early, but I felt like I had enough sleep.	1.0 I try to always go for extra sleep.
0.0 The party that was thrown for me was for my 30th. I think it made friends and family just as happy as it made me.	1.0 Wow! 30th is a big milestone birthday! I can imagine that everyone was excited to get to share that with you.
0.0 Thank you! I was glad to share that moment with them.	1.0 Did you feel old after?
0.0 i was frustrated because i could not print a document, and a co worker showed me a keyboard shortcut to find it everytime.	1.0 That had to be relief. So now you won't have to deal with that frustration again.
0.0 Yes indeed, it was frustrating!  I didn't have time to mess with it everytime i had to print something.	1.0 Those keyboard shortcuts can be lifesavers.
0.0 Some things have changed in my life and my close friends have family have helped me through, which I really appreciate.	1.0 Thats good. Everyone isnt so fortunate.
0.0 For sure, thank you. Times can change very unexpectedly. 	1.0 Its goof to have support when it does change.
0.0 Definitely, I think we all need to support each other better in this world. 	1.0 Exactly
0.0 Hopefully we can find some kindness in the world and get the support we all need. 	1.0 We would all be better people then
0.0 One day I randomly got a raise, not something I was expecting!	1.0 oh wow. Bet it felt amazing. was it a mistake?
0.0 Thanks! It wasn't a mistake. Just unexpected and pretty neat!	1.0 sounds like a great day. makes you wish it would happen everyday
0.0 I was at the store and accidentally knocked over some items. I could feel my face turning red.	1.0 That's so embarrassing! What did you do?
0.0 I picked them up and tried to move to another area!	1.0 Did anyone say anything?
0.0 I don't think so. I seem to do these things quite often.	1.0 Well at least you got away with it this time!
0.0 I was flying alone, even though I had before, this particular time I felt wary.	1.0 Really? Why was that?
0.0 I think I felt concerned that the plane would crash or that something else bad might happen. 	1.0 Do you normally feel like that when you fly?
0.0 I was traveling on a plane by myself and I felt kind of scared.	1.0 I can understand that, flying is scary.
0.0 It is. We ended up going through a thunderstorm.	1.0 I'm glad you didn't get hurt.
0.0 Hello!	1.0 Hey, do you have anything on your mind?
0.0 Yeah! i just received an email from guild wars 2 customer support, I lost my game code so i couldnt recover my account (forgot password), and they sent an email back asking me for the code. its so surprising having to deal with people this stupid, you would think that they would never get hired to begin with	1.0 I agree, incompetent customer support is one of the worst things when dealing with such problems.
0.0 I recently lost my dog, after 13 years.	1.0 oh I am so sorry for your loss.
0.0 Yeah, it was terrible.  Heart wrenching to bury him.	1.0 I bet. You gave him a good long life, that was the best you could do.
0.0 When a spot came open for a supervisor job at my employer, that was a stressful week for me.	1.0 I am sorry it was so stressful
0.0 They had many qualified candidates and it took a full week for them to make their decision.	1.0 Just hope for the best
0.0 I had to work the day that my boyfriend and his family went to a Christmas party.	1.0 ugh thats the worst right.. everyone should have holidays off. 
0.0 It wasn't even a holiday, just on a Saturday during the day because the drive was so long.	1.0 I say skip work next time :p go for it 
0.0 When my daughter was a baby she couldn't talk so I taught her sign language.	1.0 i just love that, my son knows ASL
0.0 That's great! I taught her a few words that were interesting to her so she could tell us what she needed.	1.0 i wish schools would teach kids asl 
0.0 My sister in law planned a get together during a time we couldn't go.	1.0 she wants to spend time with you
0.0 Well no, she knew we couldn't go out late because of my son's bedtime and scheduled it anyway.	1.0 that was nice of her
0.0 My mother in law wanted to take my daughter to Colorado, but she is only 3.	1.0 its a beautiful place
0.0 I'm sure it is, but she is very young and still looks for me in the morning.	1.0 in that case i agree then
0.0 We were going on vacation and I made a list of everything we could possibly need when we were there.	1.0 Where are you going on vacation?
0.0 We went to New Jersey, so a long way for us. We had a toddler, so I had to make sure I had everything for her.	1.0 That is close for me, but it is a fun time!
0.0 I seem to be always alert, so that even something loud happens, I remain calm.	1.0 i admire that 
0.0 I just wander, is this normal?	1.0 no its not
0.0 I have been having bad Anxiety for months. I cante seem to get a to stop.	1.0 I see, have you tried yoga and meditation? 
0.0 Nope.But have been practicing breathing and muscle relaxation	1.0 Keep a positive mindset and your anxieties will be relieved! 
0.0 I was having my second baby and my friends threw me a baby shower without me knowing.	1.0 Oh my, you must have very surprised! 
0.0 Yes, I was not expecting it at all. They invited us over to hang out.	1.0 It must have been an enjoyable day. You have nice friends!
0.0 I couldn't sleep on Christmas eve. I was ready to see my daughter's face when she woke up in the morning.	1.0 i bet she was so excited!! Did she love her presents?
0.0 Yeah she did, but I guess I was looking forward to it more than she was.	1.0 that was me last christmas lol my son was only 9 months old but i bought so many presents and i was so excited to see his reaction
0.0 I really like my job. I'm worried that I will lose it.	1.0 Oh no. Why are you worried to lose it?
0.0 I don't have as much work to do as in the past and no one needs help with anything.	1.0 Oh no.. That is a bit scary. I wish the best for you!
0.0 Thanks! I hope more work will come soon. Are you doing well? 	1.0 I am, thank you for asking!
0.0 I ordered a pizza today, but it really wasn't a pleasant experience.	1.0 Oh no, why not?!
0.0 The guy that took my order was rude, but I understand, most people can't control themselves...	1.0 They really can't. It's still no excuse though.
0.0 I can't believe my friend wouldn't answer her phone when I waited over an hour for her to pick me up!	1.0 Oh that sucks...did she explain herself yet
0.0 No, she just completely blew me off. I found out she was out on a date instead and didn't tell me.	1.0 Sounds like you need a new friend or your own car...or both lol
0.0 My neighbor is the worst! He has a dog that he just keeps chained up in the backyard, and he rarely feeds it. Last week I saw it and he looks anorexic.	1.0 That's terrible.  Someone should call animal control on them.
0.0 I know, what kind of human being would do that to a poor dog! I'm going to call animal control soon.	1.0 I hope they do something to help that poor puppy.
0.0 i was so shocked by the behavior of my friends dog	1.0 what happened ? 
0.0 when i knocked on the door i felt the door was open and i thought as he is in home itself i felt i can go in but suddenly his dog jumped on me	1.0 did he end up biting you?? 
0.0 My dog got really sick and was coughing up blood last week. I didn't know what to do. I had a panic attack.	1.0 Oh no, that's terrible!  Are both you and your dog alright now?
0.0 Yes, I took him to the vet and got him the help he needed. The possibility of losing my best friend had me frightened!	1.0 Yes, that would have frightened me too.  I'm glad he's alright now.
0.0 Financially, things will turn around for my family soon!	1.0 I hope and wish so. In this tough economic climate many are finding it difficult to cope with financial responsibilities

0.0 I have never heard of Twitch.  That is a lot of money, I could retire!	1.0 Twitch is just a place where people stream themselves playing video games.  I guess a lot of people really love watching good players.  Go ahead and retire now and get him started!

0.0 Not too much, but when she asked I said we did, but we were talking about two different things.	1.0 I always hate that when you are never on the right wavelength with someone during a conversation

0.0 I know, but since it was my first time I didn't know how to act. My mind started to go blank and I started to sweat profusely. 	1.0 I understand completely. It's that initial anxiety. It's a scary thing to do!
0.0 I couldn't wait for my mom to finally get here from New Jersey. She would stay about a week and a half.	1.0 I bet you are pretty anxious and excited at the same time.
0.0 Yeah, she would be able to see the kids, and she hardly ever comes to visit.	1.0 its always nice when grandmas come visit.
0.0 Last week, my brother landed a 900 on his skateboard like Tony Hawk at a skating competition.	1.0 Oh wow, that sounds like it might be cool but I don't know what that looks like, what is the 900?

0.0 We go camping a lot during the summer. My favorite piece of equipment is my hammock!	1.0 I love camping, and understand why a hammock is your favorite. They're so comfortable!

0.0 Yes, I live in Orlando so I was lucky that it was central, but we were out of power for a few days. 	1.0 That was lucky. Losing power is bad, but at least that was it. Scary situation. 
0.0 I really feel good when my friends keep my secrets. (Or at least I think they do!)	1.0 What will happen if the secret is told?
0.0 Not much, I just value my privacy. Do you have secrets that you tell your friends?	1.0 Of course, I only tell them the best ones though!
0.0 My sister in law got upset when she was over and I was trying to talk to her about it.	1.0 Oh no, was she upset at you or about something else?

0.0 I was at a concert a few weeks ago with my son and he had to go to the bathroom.  There were so many people there, mostly adults, and they refused to move so we could make it to the family bathroom.	1.0 Ugh, people can be so rude. Was he able to go to the bathroom?
0.0 He was not, there were just too many people standing around not moving.	1.0 That's awful!! So what did you end up doing? Did he just have to pop a squat?
0.0 I'm really hopeful that I'll land a new promotion at work. 	1.0 As long as you work hard and stay dedicated, I'm sure it will come!
0.0 I hope so! Hard work and dedication tend to pay off. 	1.0 Absolutely! And if you trust your boss, I'm sure he will do the right thing.
0.0 As we were driving on the highway we got caught in a big storm.	1.0 Thats scary.  Did you have to pull over?

0.0 We went on the cruise in February. It was a Disney cruise in the Bahamas! What a great experience.	1.0 I've ALWAYS wanted to go on a Disney cruise - it's probably my dream vacation. I'm so jealous!!!
0.0 I was so glad when I graduated college	1.0 That's such a great accomplishment and such a relief at the same time. What was your major?

0.0 I'm so sorry to hear that. What kind of breed was your dog? 	1.0 Border Collie. Yours?
0.0 I was very scared when flying for the first time	1.0 I can imagine! Did you end up having a good flight?
0.0 I did. Luckily no turbulance!	1.0 That's good! Hopefully you had a nice seatmate too!
0.0 My son starts school soon, we had a fun day out but when we got home he was really bad.	1.0 Aww, was he scared?
0.0 I don't think so, I think he was just over the day and it was too much for him.	1.0 I can see that. School is a challenging time for a kid.
0.0 I was very ready going into my test	1.0 Always good to feel ready for something like that. What subject was it in?
0.0 Engingeering. It was really tough!	1.0 Man, I remember those days. My engineering exams were killer. Did you do well on it?
0.0 Anytime we take a trip, I normally save what some people consider trash.	1.0 Another man's trash is another man's treasure! What things do you save?
0.0 Just different things that I can scrapbook, mementos from my trip. 	1.0 I keep a scrapbook myself! I love collecting stamps. Got any trips planned this year?
0.0 My pants feel down when riding my bike	1.0 I'm so sorry that happened to you. How did you handle this situation?

0.0 I was scared of going into the caves	1.0 Please describe what scared you about the caves.
0.0 Just the darkness.	1.0 That seems like a valid reason to be scared of going into the caves!
0.0 We live in a very high cost of living area but don't make a ton of money. 	1.0 Is there anyway you can move to somewhere more affordable?
0.0 I'm not sure, sometimes I wish I had what the other people around me had.	1.0 I do too but it's natural to get envious of others sometimes, don't put yourself down over it.
0.0 Sometimes people ask me to do a lot of other stuff when I already have a lot on my plate.	1.0 That must be so annoying. I get that sometimes too.
0.0 I feel like people don't care that I have stuff to do.	1.0 I'm sad to hear that, I'm sure there is someone who cars.
0.0 My son went to the best preschool. When I needed him to stay late, they always had space for him. 	1.0 That's good to hear that you care for your son so much. I am sure he will be quite an intelligent child going to the best of the best.
0.0 I hope so, it really helps to get your village when you have kids.	1.0 Yeah, my village helped with my son's preschool tuition as well. Strength in numbers and good neighbors!

0.0 I felt upset when I forgot to ask my friend to dinner.	1.0 I'm sure they will understand. You can always have another dinner, that's the beauty of life!
0.0 That is true. Good way to look at things!	1.0 Where did you end up going?
0.0 Tomorrow's my last day of work. I can't believe it. I wish I had something lined up. 	1.0 Oh no, have you look at other options?

0.0 I was so mad when some guy cut me off in traffic!	1.0 Oh no. Did you flip him off?
0.0 No, I remained calm, but I was very mad!	1.0 That was probably for the best anyway. People who drive like that are the worst, though.
0.0 i couldnt stand it when my neighbor was using power tools at 8 am on a saturday	1.0 Wow, that's super annoying! I understand wanting to get things done early, but that's not very respectful to neighbors.
0.0 nope, it was very frustrating, he lives next door too	1.0 Have you talked to him about it?
0.0 I'm pretty worried about what the future will hold. I lose my job tomorrow. Trying to keep my head up! 	1.0 are you getting laid off?

0.0 I was really scared when Hurricane Irma came through Florida last year. It was a pretty horrible experience.	1.0 Do you live in Florida?
0.0 I do, in Orlando. I feel lucky to have had no damage to my home and been in a central location, but the storm was awful and we had no power for 4 days.	1.0 Wow, that sounds terrifying. You are very lucky to have made it out without any property damage though.
0.0 I work online to make extra money for things my family wants.	1.0 Thats amazing, you must be a good person
0.0 It's nice to be able to pay for fun things that our budget doesn't allow us to normally do.	1.0 How many kids do you have?
0.0 i felt bored being by myself all week	1.0 Sometimes i like to not have other people asking things of me. Alone can be good.
0.0 it was just boring because i had so much work to get done	1.0 Well at least you didn't have a lot of people under foot to slow you down. So I hope the sacrifice of being bored was worth it.
0.0 My son's school starts next week and they just changed the first day of school!	1.0 I am so sorry to hear that!

0.0 Yeah, it makes me miss being at home and around my family.	1.0 Oh I bet! It's always good to cherish those memories.
0.0 I was watching my favorite tv show and my husband kept talking to me during it.	1.0 oh that can be annoying, did you tell him anything?
0.0 I just gave him a look. The thing is he says I do that instead of waiting til commercial, but then he goes and does it to me.	1.0 hahah that's kinda funny. Maybe he just missed you!

0.0 A tarantula bit me in my living room the other day and I thought I was going to die.	1.0 Oh my gosh! Was it a wild tarantula or a pet?
0.0 It was a wild tarantula. I had my family rush me to the hospital, but I ended up being just fine. It only caused me discomfort for a couple of days.	1.0 Thank goodness! The biggest type of spider we have here if a wolf spider. They don't really bite you unless you irritate them.
0.0 Last week, my childhood friend came to visit from out of town. I couldn't stop smiling when we hung out.	1.0 Oh awesome! How are they doing?

0.0 I was thinking about how I missed my grandma	1.0 I have the same feeling. I miss her also
0.0 She passed last year. She is in a better place.	1.0 Sorry to hear that
0.0 I have a work project coming up that needs to be completed	1.0 Are you going to have it completed in time?  I hope you are not behind schedule!
0.0 I still have much to be done	1.0 Ouch!  You better knuckle down and burn the midnight oil!
0.0 So I walked into work this morning. I have a new boss. He's 20 and had a PhD. I'm amazed.	1.0 Wow! I would be amazed too!
0.0 A little worried. While super smart as we get older we gain real world experience in dealing with people that you can not learn in a book. But still at 20 I was struggling with my associates degree. 	1.0 That's so true. Im 30 and just now having the time to work on my bachelors. But I have a lot of work experience.
0.0 I'm 34 and still working on the BA as well. When life got in the way education had to take a back seat.	1.0 Same here. Well I hope he can adapt and do well. Good luck with your BA too!
0.0 So ever single day my boss is late to work. 20 minutes or more. Today I was 1 minute late, first time in 2 years and I got a wrote up.	1.0 Wow. That's pretty hypocritical.
0.0 Yea, I even called and let them know the highway was closed down and I was going to be late. I even text her photo of the traffic accident once I got up to it.	1.0 I think she's just trying to cause a problem.
0.0 I was hungry and took my co-workers food	1.0 Did you not have your own food?
0.0 I didn't have any that day, I was also out of money	1.0 Oh no! That sounds horrible! Did the co-worker find out?
0.0 This morning I don't know what got into me but on the way to work I picked up a homeless guy. 	1.0 Oh wow. Give me the details.
0.0 Yea, as I pulled over I thought it was someone down on his luck. Nope, he was crazy.	1.0 Are you missing an organs?
0.0 Haha, it started off ok. He was going to the train station. I agreed to take him. With in minutes he was talking to him self. 	1.0 Well, At least you're in one piece. you could have been in several.
0.0 Went on a first date last weekend. Had some sort of BBQ appetizer early in the date. Yummy, yea well not really! 	1.0 Not really? How come?
0.0 Well, after about an hour I got up to pee. As I washed my hands I looked up and my face was covered with sauce. It looked like someone poured it on my face, 	1.0 Oh wow, the BBQ must be delicious.
0.0 Do you ever wake up and realize how lucky we are? I travel a lot and I just got back from Haiti. I'm convinced it's better to be poor in America then rich in Haiti.	1.0 That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted, especially when some people say it's in its "worst state in a long time." We're prisoners of the moment.
0.0 Those that criticize have not traveled the real world out side resort gates or into the third world. Then you see a real state that is in trouble.	1.0 Yeah, I guess you would know for sure, since you've seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti, that's just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti, if you don't mind me asking?
0.0 Monday I was downtown for work. I was on my way home when a homeless man asked form some money. I went to reach for my wallet and it was gone.	1.0 I am sorry to hear that.Is there a chance you forgot your wallet home?
0.0 No it was stolen. So when I went to reach for it. The homeless man could tell something was wrong. He actually paid for my train ticket home. I end up seeing him again today. Took him out to lunch and gave him some money.	1.0 That story could become a movie script.
0.0 All I want in life this weekend is to sleep and I have to work. 	1.0 That’s a bummer. Drink some coffee
0.0 Coffee dose even phase me anymore. The lack of sleep is making my soul sad.	1.0 Try drinking a lot of water and cutting out soda
0.0 This weekend was supposed to be my first weekend off in 2 months. 	1.0 Is it not going to happen?
0.0 Nope, my boss who only works one weekend a month has decided this month she is not going to work any weekends.	1.0 That sucks. 
0.0 Yea, she is not a very good boss and now I'm super bummed. 	1.0 You should find another job. No use being miserable. Or tell her boss!
0.0 I recently took my ELS certification test. I studied really hard, so I'm sure I passed it.	1.0 What's ELS?
0.0 Sorry, ESL. It's English as a Second Language. It just means I am certified to teach students that don't speak fluent English.	1.0 Ah, gotcha. A few of my friends teach English to Chinese students online and I think they have taken ESL courses
0.0 I just moved into my new house and I am having a cockroach problem.	1.0 That really sucks! What do you have to do?
0.0 I'm just using Raid right now, but I will call an exterminator tomorrow. I hate bugs so I am freaking out a little bit.	1.0 I do too.  I am so sorry you are going through this
0.0 When I was in New York, I got to see STOMP. It was an amazing show.	1.0 Wow. I had that DVD.
0.0 I used to watch it in music class a lot. I am fascinated by the way they make music with everyday items.	1.0 I know. I wonder if they still do that show
0.0 I love my dad. He only made me pay half of the money I owed him and let me keep the rest for my pet deposit.	1.0 Some dads are cool like that. My mom is that way sometimes.
0.0 I was shocked. I was fully prepared to pay the full thing. He's great.	1.0 I just went on a trip with my mom and sh paid for almost everything
0.0 my bus broke down and i was late for work, again!	1.0 Are you a busdriver?
0.0 no i ride a bus to work. this has happened twice in the past month. i need to get a car	1.0 Ah, gotcha. I hate it when things happen out of our control. Hope you get it figured out
0.0 Hey there	1.0 Hi what you got going on?
0.0 Uhm.. just feeling blue. My gf broke up with me recently and got married to an investment banker	1.0 That is really sad.  Are you alright?
0.0 I feel so bad that i failed my last semester exam	1.0 I'm sorry.  Will you be able to pass this semester/
0.0 I am doing my best to pass	1.0 I'm sure it will happen.
0.0 i will be presenting my project to the company and am tensed about it	1.0 I am sure you will do well!
0.0 Yes, i have prepared for two months now	1.0 I don't think you will need to worry then.
0.0 My best friend had arranged for my birthday party, but she did not attend, i feel so bad	1.0 Sorry to hear that. Why did they not attend?
0.0 he was at work 	1.0 Hopefully your friend can make it up to you and hang out with you some time soon.
0.0 my parents went on vacation and i am left aloe in the house	1.0 Ha, hope you aren't too scarred about being all by yourself.
0.0 i am scared, especially at night	1.0 Watching too many horror movies I bet. Just put on some comedy special.
0.0 Man I am so glad I was able to climb out of poverty.	1.0 That's quite an accomplishment. You must have worked very hard.
0.0 I was homeless for about a year.  It felt like every day I would just descened even further.  But I always held out hope that things would get better.	1.0 That must have been a very hard time. Your persistence led you to this success because you never gave up that hope.
0.0 I'm so pleased with myself right now.  I saved up enough money to make all of my car payments at once next month.	1.0 That's very good. It takes a disciplined person to save money
0.0 Heh, well I didn't exactly save money that mush.  I just hunkered down and started working harder and asked for more hours.	1.0 You truely are determined to get that car, what brand is it?
0.0 i am confident i am going to pass my exam	1.0 I hope you pass your exam. Did you do good at your exam?
0.0 yes, i always read hard	1.0 Good luck
0.0 Man I had an absolute blast from the past last week.	1.0 Really? What happened? 
0.0 I found my old elementary school.  I hear it was going to be torn down next month, so I toured the inside.	1.0 Wow, cool! Did they let you in? It's so cool you had that opportunity.
0.0 Yeah I went to a used car lot yesterday to check out a car I saw on the internet.  Not happy.	1.0 Ick. I've never heard of anyone having a really good experience with that.
0.0 Well I realzied that the owner had taken the pictures of the car from a large distance.  Up close it was very disappointing.	1.0 Ah, I see. The classic photo trick. I understand why you would be upset about that. That's definitly why it's so important to go see before you buy
0.0 hi	1.0 Hi, tell me what's going on with you?
0.0 not going.hoe are u?	1.0 Oh, I'm well thank you.
0.0 Man I am so cheesed off today!	1.0 Oh really? Any reason why?
0.0 Yeah I was buying something in electronics and this guy shows up out of nowhere and starts criticizing my purchase!	1.0 Wow really? That's pretty rude and bad in general for an employee to be doing.
0.0 You'll never guess what I saw on the road today.	1.0 Do tell
0.0 I saw a bear crossing the road a mile from my job.	1.0 That's neat! I've only seen ducks and chickens. A deer did bounce over my car once, though
0.0 Man I was so stoked to check my bank account today	1.0 I guess it didn't turn out well?
0.0 No man it was GREAT.  I finally got my first paycheck after my rasie!	1.0 oh.  SWEET!  Congrats!  What are you going to do with all that money??
0.0 Well I was gonna buy a few video games, but I'll of course set some aside.  No need to go crazy.	1.0 Save it for Spider-Man that comes out next month!  I can't wait for that
0.0 Thinking about it!  But  I may not have to, as by then I'll get another paycheck at this pay grade!	1.0 And more to come hopefully!  Don't forget to save for retirement and/or emergency fund :D
0.0 hi	1.0 Hello
0.0 how are you?	1.0 Am doing well thanks and you?
0.0 hi	1.0 hi
0.0 how are you?	1.0 fine. But, I think you're suppose to do the prompts, so hope it doesn't cause you a rejection.
0.0 hi	1.0 What have your experiences been like?
0.0 so nice my experience.	1.0 That's good to hear! Hope that it continues that way.
0.0 I feel angry i have to pay with an interest	1.0 Oh I hate that. Is it a high interest rate?
0.0 yes, it is exorbitant just to say	1.0 It's highway robbery. Well I can only hope you can pay it quickly to avoid as much of that as possible.
0.0 One of my friends sent me a lot of money for my birthday right when I needed it a lot.	1.0 You read
0.0 I do read a lot of articles.	1.0 That's great , sorry for the error and unrelated message previously sent :) but you do have great friend that are dependable
0.0 There was one time when I was in grade school and the fire alarm went off when I was in the bathroom.  I had a hard time buttoning my pants up and had to walk out holding them together in front of my classmates.	1.0 Oh my god, that must have been so embarrasing! Was there actually a fire?
0.0 Nope, it turned out to be a fire drill.  Everyone was laughing at me.  It wasn't one of my prouder moments.	1.0 Its okay, at least now you can look back at it as a funny moment.
0.0 I am sitting here and guessing when will the wi-fi stop working.	1.0 Oh no, I hate having connectivity problems! Are you having bad weather?
0.0 Yep its raining cats and dogs in here.	1.0 Oh, it has been raining here a lot too. I will keep my fingers crossed that your wi-fi keeps working!
0.0 Is anyone here?	1.0 Yes, I am here
0.0 Yes, I had fully charged it and after like 6-7 rides it had 3% left.	1.0 Oh no, I bet that was stressful. What did you do?
0.0 Recently I've been enjoying being by myself.	1.0 I like my alone time too. What do you enjoy doing by yourself?
0.0 I just love people watch, if that's considered alone time.	1.0 Oh that's is fun. It's a way to be alone with your thoughts, but still be around others. I love to watch people! 
0.0 When I wake up and know that I am doing the things that I like, I feel great.	1.0 Yes I can related to that feeling
0.0 I don't think people realize iportance of that in their life.	1.0 Well, a great morning leads to a great day 
0.0 i watched a horror movie and i feel terrified and anxious all the time	1.0 Which movie did you watch?
0.0 lost 	1.0 That is a very scary movie! How are you coping?
0.0 It was really hurtful	1.0 What was hurtful may I ask?
0.0 Well, they made me leave everything at my desk, walked me downstairs, turn in my badge, and would mail my belonings.	1.0 That sounds like very bad treatment, You should sue them
0.0 I feel very strange for not feeling any remorse about anything really.	1.0 Maybe you haven't done anything terribly wrong that anyone would feel remorseful about. Do you think that's it?
0.0 I think it might just be a stage in life.	1.0 Maybe. It's none of my business but sometimes when people feel this way, they could be experiencing depression. 
0.0 Is it terribleto always feel ok, and not wait for the bad times	1.0 I suppose it is.
0.0 Than I will go on feeling this way I guess, or do I have another option?	1.0 You always have options!
0.0 She was actually always blind-sinding nice to my face and back-stabbing the other.	1.0 Sounds like someone who is actually not a friend. How long have you known her?
0.0 I have known her less than a year.	1.0 I used to work with a girl like that. She always talked bad about me but was nice to my face.
0.0 Do you ever feel that now you have finally grasped what life really is..	1.0 I can't say that I really do. It's always a mystery in my mind.
0.0 Or is the sign of overconfidence, like they say, -  there are two types of bikes, those that were in an accident, and those that will be?	1.0 I believe I see it more as that type. No one can truly know.
0.0 Some markets have to be avoided, that is if you valued your sense of smell.	1.0 I know what you mean. Wednesdays there's this market I like to go to, but lately it just has so much rotten food
0.0 Yet there's still something about that imperfection, do you agree?	1.0 Totally. I still love to go have a look around
0.0 Don't you think that the only one really capable of bringing you down, is you?	1.0 Yes, it is partially true. What is the problem?
0.0 There aren't any, I am just drawing a conclusion from past experience. 	1.0 I understand.
0.0 Sometime all it take is one rude person to ruin your day.	1.0 That is very true. Did something bad happen to you?
0.0 Nothing major, but I am still learning how to deal with such behavior and always open for an advice. 	1.0 Generally just try to ignore it as best as you can. I'm good about just letting things roll off my back.
0.0 when i went for shopping i parked my car at a no parking zone which i am not aware , police approached the car and was about to tow it away	1.0 Oh no! Those can be difficult to spot sometimes.
0.0 yes exactly , but i also had my 4 6 month old 11 month old baby with me .	1.0 Wow. That must have been stressful. I have babies, too. Did they understand?
0.0 ya after they had seen my 11 month old baby with me they felt they should not trouble me by towing away car . i felt very thankful to them	1.0 That is a relief. Sounds like you made it just in time.
0.0 gosh ive been feeling so nervous for the past 24 hours, its almost like an impending sense of doom, To my knowledge theres nothing about to go wrong or blow up in my face but it feels like something is going badly	1.0 I get it. Sometimes I feel stressed out for no real reason myself.
0.0 i ordered some semi expensive tablet yesterday so maybe its that but like, i cant think of a logical reason why that would go wrong so im left wondering why i feel so nervous, its really weird, very hard to relax like this	1.0 Well sometimes companies make mistakes. I doubt it's anything you did.
0.0 I've been recently thinking about the things we don't appreciate.	1.0 I think it's very common that we take things for granted. 
0.0 Is there anything that can change that?	1.0 I think you can really think about all that you have, and show your thanks that you have these things. 
0.0 Yah, was depressing.	1.0 What was depressing?
0.0 Well, just really did a lot of housework and felt we lost contact.	1.0 Oh, that sounds like a bummer. Do you think it will change?
0.0 have you ever watched this show it was really quite good?	1.0 What is the name of the show?
0.0 It was called Hero's	1.0 No, I ever did.
0.0 I am currently waiting to receive my security deposit back from my old apartment.	1.0 why hasnt it already been returned?
0.0 They said it takes up to 30 days, and it's only been a few weeks.	1.0 if you live in america and they fail to return it in a timely manner, i hear you can go to small claims and get 3x the amount awarded to you 
0.0 Wow, that's good to know.	1.0 yeah r/legaladvice has a lot of posts like that so its something that stuck to me, Pretty neat to know that landlords cant just scam you
0.0 I ordered a surface pro yesterday! its gonna be so cool to play around with when it arrives	1.0 That's cool. I've always been a Mac kind of girl, but I would look into a Surface is I was in the market for a new computer.
0.0 i only ever wanted one cause they can do the same stuff a regular computer can but also touch screen so you can draw on it, i always got discouraged drawing on paper cause id waste so much of it, and then just stop	1.0 I get that. I got a bamboo tablet a few years ago, but I feel like working directly on the screen would be even better.
0.0 It was such a sweet moment.	1.0 what was ?
0.0 Spending time watching TV and sipping wine together.	1.0 oh that does sound nice
0.0 As the day was coming to an end, I was begging to believe that my solitude was perfect.  	1.0 Well in some ways solitude is nice.
0.0 Yes if you take it in portions. 	1.0 True everything is nice in bits. Too much of anything does get tiring.
0.0 But I needed to be responsible.	1.0 Be responsible about what?
0.0 Well, about getting daily chorses done--work first-- play later.	1.0 I understand. I have to get work around my house done today too, before I can go out.
0.0 I got backed into last week by another car.	1.0 Oh no, sorry to hear, hope you are OK.
0.0 I'm fine, but they left a nasty dent in the front of my car. Now I have to get it fixed, which is a hassle.	1.0 I agree. Hope the car will look good again.
0.0 Meh i kinda feel bad, i wish i had family members to talk to	1.0 Sorry to hear that. Did you try to talk to a friend?
0.0 friends are cool but its not quite the same as a family member, a spouse would be but i dont have that either!	1.0 I understand
0.0 Yah, two colored socks is crazy.	1.0 I agree, where did you find them?
0.0 LOL, mixed up in my drawer.	1.0 Oh I see, Ha! I would have just worn them like that to be more fashionable!
0.0 when i was travelling alone in a car at night in ghat road suddenly some boulders fell on the road 	1.0 Was it an accident?
0.0 no the boulders fell 50 meters infront of me , luckily i was going slow and suddenly stopped	1.0 Oh ! Thank good ness! That was close
0.0 I ate so many macadamia nuts today, I don't know how to feel about it.	1.0 do you especially enjoy macadamia nuts or just eating?
0.0 It the only nut that I can eat, that's why I can't help overeating.	1.0 It must be difficult living with a nut allergy. Do you overeat on macadamia nuts regularly?
0.0 its sooooooo hot outside, 30c. its borderline impossible to deal with	1.0 It's awful out there. It's been in the 100's here in TX
0.0 oh no, texas is basically in a desert isnt it. for me on top of heat i also get some 3 wasps a day flying into my apartament and looking around, i just got one earlier and had to kill it to get rid of it. very annoying, apparently wasps love it though	1.0 That sucks! I hate wasps and most other bugs, so I feel your annoyance.
0.0 I start back at work in a couple of weeks.	1.0 what job did you apply to?
0.0 I'm a teacher, so I've been off this summer. I am looking forward to having 12th graders again this year.	1.0 Somehow i suspect that theyre not looking forward to having you though :P (no offence) i cant remember anyone that enjoyed high school lol. Its a good job though! literally backbone of society
0.0 I always trust my family like my mom to give me good advice.	1.0 Yeah that's always comforting.  Mom's are awesome
0.0 Do you ever disagree with your Mom?	1.0 Not really.  We usually tend to think alike.  Why do you ask?  
0.0 Aww, I didn't really relate until I had children of my own	1.0 Cool.  So you're the awesome mother here?
0.0 i was really pissed off when i found out my best friend slept with my girlfriend. i was shaking all over!	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that
0.0 yeah well. what you gonna do.. thats life..	1.0 :( did you stay friends with him?
0.0 i had recently applied for graduate masters in very prestigious universities but initially i was worried whether i get admission or not	1.0 did you get admission? 
0.0 yeah i thought the competition was tough and i may not get admitted, but luckily i was admitted	1.0 That's great news, well done. 
0.0 yes i am totally relived of that stress now	1.0 :) 
0.0 I hate when I am tired.	1.0 Me too, especially when it's still the middle of the day.
0.0 or in the case here, morning	1.0 Oh yes, you're right. I'm in the same boat right now!
0.0 i ate 3 pizzas just earlier and i feel so good and relaxed now, almost tranquility	1.0 I think I am missing something, you said you feel more that ok after 3 pizzas???
0.0 yeah i know right, a lot, and i am pretty thin so i shouldnt feel ok, But i totally do feel great .	1.0 It's definitely some kind of anomaly. 
0.0 Sometime ago I was really hungry and decided to treat myself to some well reviewed restaurant, well it was all I hoped for.	1.0 What did you eat there? 
0.0 Onion soup with croutons.	1.0 ooooh onion soup sounds really good, onions do taste incredibly well if cooked well with the correct dish
0.0 i was extremely disgusted when a close friend of mine threw up on my baby. he was really drunk at a party we were at	1.0 I would have flipped and never talked to him again. I am so sorry my god what did you do? 
0.0 what else can i do? i washed my kid clean and got the hell out of there	1.0 Idk beat him up, lol. throw a drink at him, the sky is the limit! 
0.0 I just finished making my bulletin board at work.	1.0 cool, how did it come by?
0.0 I'm happy with it. Hopefully my students like it too.	1.0 if you put so much work into it, im sure they will
0.0 i was so angry when i found out that my girlfriend cheated on me.. dont know how i can forgive her	1.0 I am so sorry! I would have a hard time forgiving that betrayal of trust. How long have you been together?
0.0 3 years	1.0 Wow. I hope that you can work it out, but I would understand why you wouldn't want to.

0.0 i felt really good about my change to new york after getting a job	1.0 No way! I just moved from NY to FL. You are going to love NY tho, its an awesome state. Congrats on the job! 
0.0 thank you so much.. i moved from Idaho.. so this is very new to me, all this	1.0 Oh yeah sounds like its super new to you especially if you are in the city. I was in the middle of no where so pretty much felt like Idaho where I lived in NY. :p 
0.0 i felt heartbroken when my girlfriend moved away without telling me first	1.0 I would too why would she not tell you!? Did yall break up? 
0.0 we had a fight, i never knew we were broken up though	1.0 That sounds like poor communication on her part maybe its better for you she moved. :/ 
0.0 hi there it was a hard day when this incident occured.	1.0 What incident was that ?
0.0 i was driving home and it started to rain	1.0 what happened then ?
0.0 my dad passed away around the time of christmas.. it always casts a shadow over my holidays	1.0 I know what you mean, it sucks when those "dates" linger over us even if we try not to think about them. Im so sorry to hear that! 
0.0 yeah.. i know it is time to get over it. but certain memories are so haunting	1.0 Its not time to get over it, you arent doing any wrong its okay to "feel" things. I hope people around you give you a lot of love!

0.0 it is a terrifying movie. havent you seen it yet?	1.0 no i never heard of it
0.0 yesterday i was so angry at my parents.. but i kept my mouth shut and came away. i cant hurt them, i feel so faithful	1.0 yea thats probably the best choice to make
0.0 i always think all those hard times they had bringing me up	1.0 i can understand that
0.0 some guy threw up on the street last night right before me.. i was grossed out	1.0 Yuck, that is terrible. I would be grossed out too. What did you do?
0.0 i got the hell out of there right away!	1.0 I'm sure you did. Guess he couldn't make it to the trash can.

0.0 i love thinking about fond memories with my family	1.0 Those are great aren'
0.0 do you have a large family?	1.0 Sorry(Those are great aren't they?) I do not but we always had sunday breakfast for many years. Those memories are to be cherished and repeated :)
0.0 My roommate recently moved out of my house so now it is just me and my dog.  My dog is really nice and doesn't really bark unless he sees a stranger coming up to the house.  Lately he has been sitting at the top of the steps to the basement and growls/barks.  However, there are no windows to the basement and he wouldnt be able to see into the basement.  I have no idea why he has been barking at that door lately.	1.0 wow that is a lot to take in.  get a muzzle
0.0 I'm not bothered by him barking.  As someone who watches a lot of scary movies it is more of a worry factor that someone is down there than anything.	1.0 i can understand that
0.0 I got a job offer at another company that pays more, but I turned them down because I've been with my current company for ten years.	1.0 Do you think it was the right decision?
0.0 Definitely, my company always treat's me right. They haven't gave me a reason to want to leave. 	1.0 That's great. Maybe you will get a raise too
0.0 i felt shy when i dropped my groceries in the parking lot	1.0 why is that
0.0 because there were soda cans rolling all around the parking lot and i was scrambling to pick them all up	1.0 oh i can understand that
0.0 The other day an intruder broke into my home. I had to hide in the closet while I called the cops.	1.0 That must have been terrifying

0.0 Yeah I am thinking this guy must be a CEO or something. If I had the money I would buy one for sure.	1.0 Same here. I saw a Ferrari at the supermarket the other day. I was jealous, and I also thought about how I would be worried something would happen to it (if it were mine).

0.0 I just like to be prepared and organized. Thats me.	1.0 It is really good to have that level of discipline
0.0 I want the ingredients all on my table before i cook	1.0 Same here.  It helps make cooking go smoother.

0.0 True! All those old memories started rushing in	1.0 Aw, i am missing my high school now that you said it
0.0 I feel such envy when i see guys with sports cars	1.0 Haha. Do you love sports cars that much?
0.0 Oh yeah.. I collected pictures of all the sports cars out there as a child, growing up	1.0 Such passion for cars. Wish you can buy one soon mate

0.0 I was so terribly sad when my granny passed away..	1.0 Oh my god, sorry to hear that my friend.. Were you guys close?
0.0 Yeah, very much. She was the one who looked after me.	1.0 How sad.. Find peace knowing that she is in heaven now
0.0 My wife was sick all last week, so I had to stick by her side.	1.0 what did she get sick off , im sorry to hear that your a great to your wife
0.0 She caught a very bad cold. I brought her soup everyday and tended to her every need.	1.0 When i get married i want to be like you , and take care of my loved one 
0.0 I gave a long, drawn out presentation at school the other day. I found the task to be very daunting.	1.0 That sounds tough.  How do you think you did?
0.0 Horrible, my palms were sweaty the entire time. I hate talking in front of large crowds.	1.0 Me, too--I'm sorrry you had to go through that.  At least it's over now, right?
0.0 My friend got accepted into Harvard University. That's my dream school. I don't understand how someone as dumb as him can get accepted there, and i'm stuck at community college.	1.0 Maybe they know a friend who knows a friend.
0.0 That's what i'm thinking, it's not what you know it's who you know.	1.0 Yep, that's the way of the world, especially with Universities to.
0.0 i recently ordered earphones online but i receive duplicate product	1.0 A duplicate? Like a fake?
0.0 yes i received a fake product , the make of earphones is very well known brand 	1.0 That  sucks.  I'd be very upset.      You have to be careful who you order from online.  Some times if the price is too goot to be true its a fake product.
0.0 I had the worst day ever yesterday.  I had just finished a long, hard day at work, I had driven the 40 minutes home, was just driving into my street and realised that I had left my bag with phone, purse and most importantly my house keys back in the office!	1.0 Oh no that is so frustrating! What did you do?
0.0 Well I wanted to cry and scream, I was so cross with myself but unfortunately as I live alone I just had to drive the 40 minutes back to the office to get them then another 40mins back home.  Where i swiftly had a little glass of wine to help lol.	1.0 Ah yes, a glass of wine might help to make that feel better. Still, what a pain. Lousy end to a lousy day. 
0.0 Exactly, so irritating.  But hey you live and learn, I guarantee you I will never leave work again without double then triple checking that I have all my belongings with me!	1.0 I would be so lost without my phone, but I could make it through an evening. The house keys though! 
0.0 I was shocked to see $200.00 included with the card.	1.0 Was it some fraudulent transaction posted on your account?
0.0 No not at all, She justed wanted to make sure I had a good birthday.	1.0 So, it was your partner who used you card
0.0 one month back i went for a wildlife safari , where i was attacked by a wild boar 	1.0 Oh no! Was anyone hurt?
0.0 ya i had bruises on my leg 	1.0 That's pretty scary.  Did the boar survive the ordeal?
0.0 it attacked me and ran into the bushes . it was a very bad experience.	1.0 Are you willing to go on another safari?
0.0 no i am done with such trips.	1.0 I'm not surprised.
0.0 My husbands brother was getting married.  I searched online and in every shop to find the perfect dress.  I finally found it, tried it on and loved it.  I couldnt buy it until the following week as I had to wait to payday so I left it over in the store.  The next day my sister in law called in.  She had been shopping and had also found the perfect dress.  She took it out of the bag to show me and I discovered it was the same dress!! Couldnt believe it.  Oh how I resented her at that moment.	1.0 That's very intense. I am sorry you had to experience that.
0.0 Oh if envy could kill - she would have been dead on the spot.  Needless to say I got over it and found another dress but just at that moment on that day...	1.0 That's good. Time heals all wounds and can be a powerful cure to pain and disdain.
0.0 I never can get myself to give away their baby items. 	1.0 You are telling me you are a hoarder?
0.0 lol no I just can't part with items that mean a lot to me like my kids baby things like first shirts ect.	1.0 Everyone is nostalgic one way or another.You are fine
0.0 I was walking down the street yesterday in my brand new summer dress.  I though i was gorgeous! Suddenly a big gust of wind came and blew my dress up around my ears! Where I succeeded in flashing my underwear to the entire street.  Oh the embarrassment.	1.0 Oh my goodness! Thats terrible. Did anyone see? My face would be bright red.
0.0 Oh my face was very red indeed and yes unfortunately I got a hugh cheer from a group of lads who witnessed it all.  I was so mortified I just ran home.  Later though I chatted about it with my friends and was finally able to laugh about it.	1.0 I'm sure this will be one of those times where you cringe when you think back on it! I'm sure you made those guy's days though
0.0 I so get how you feel because I decided to watch Insidious the other night on my own.  I scared the life out of myself afterwards because I thought I kept seeing shadows and hearing noises and had myself convinced someone or something was in the house with me!	1.0 That's crazy! I'm glad there was nothing there.
0.0 Oh no just my vivid imagination lol.  I do love a good horror but usually I watch them with my husband.  I am clearly not as brave on my own!!	1.0 Some horror movies are so great that they make you consider your own environment.
0.0 I helped a doctor's assistant over a couple of months	1.0 That's great. I bet it was wonderful experience.
0.0 It was she wasn't really good ans i had no problem helping	1.0 That's cool. Taking that experience into the next phase will be pivotal.
0.0 my car had a small accident recently	1.0 I am sorry to hear that.Did you get hurt.
0.0 no it was a minor accident , but car got damaged little	1.0 Do you have full cover?
0.0 I never did find out why there were so many police cars there today.	1.0 Where did this happen?! Were there any other people with you?
0.0 In town, I had my kids with me to buy school supplies.	1.0 Did it happen while you were in the store? I hope that your kids did not see anything too disturbing.
0.0 I found my old high school yearbooks that other day. 	1.0 Oh that is pretty cool. What did you think?
0.0 I think that I didn't appreciate not having to worry about adult stuff back then! 	1.0 Yeah, we were blissfully unaware of the real world in those days. It must have been nice to reminisce.
0.0 I am feel pretty mucky things have been pretty stable at home.	1.0 That has got to feel good!  You must feel very happy and relaxed!
0.0 Yes I am and thankful since I have 3 young kids at home, 	1.0 Cherish this time you have, because you never know when it could change!
0.0 I got a gift card to a restaurant I've been wanting to try for a long time. 	1.0 What restaurant is it for? 
0.0 It's a local non-chain Greek restaurant. It's fancy and supposed to be very good. 	1.0 Sounds good. I love mom n pop restaurants. So much better than big popular restaurants.
0.0 I went on a blind date last week. Honestly, I didn't know what to expect at first.	1.0 That sounds really interesting. Were there any good matches?
0.0 It was alright, but it was hard to find common ground at first.	1.0 Well at least you are putting yourself out there. A lot of people give up on finding love.
0.0 I have a dentist appointment tomorrow. I think I have a cavity.	1.0 Oh no, I hate cavities. Are you brushing your teeth eVeryday?
0.0 Yes, but I think I'm genetically hosed when it comes to teeth. I really hate it. 	1.0 Dang, that sucks. I hope you can find a solution for that
0.0 My son scored a perfect 1600 on the SATs!!	1.0 Wow, you must be proud! He might cure cancer next!
0.0 I am proud. And he may eventually cure cancer, but I'd settle right now for him cleaning his room!	1.0 Geniuses don't do chores my friend.
0.0 I went to my moms funeral yesterday, but surprisingly I wasn't sad at all. I was at peace because she accomplished a lot during her time here on earth.	1.0 I'm so sorry to hear about your mom. It's good that you're at peace with it, though. 
0.0 Yeah, she's in a better place now.	1.0 But a part of her is still here in you. 
0.0 My husband and sons left town for weekend. 	1.0 They left you all alone? I bet you feel lonely...
0.0 Yeah, it was cool for a while, but the house is way to quiet now	1.0 I know that feeling. I like to keep the TV on to drown out the silence
0.0 So, I bought myself a box strawberry frosted pop tarts last week. Today I went to go have one for breakfast...GONE! 	1.0 Whoever ate it all is evil!!!
0.0 I need to interrogate everyone in this house. I'm so angry. You don't mess with Mom's Pop Tarts!	1.0 I know right. I would be so furious!
0.0 My neighbor was having a party last night and wouldn't let me sleep. I felt like going out there and giving him a piece of my mind!	1.0 I would do it! Try to be calm about it at first and see how he responds.
0.0 No, next time I might snap. They never show any consideration for anybody on the block. They do whatever they want.	1.0 Yeah, something should be done about it!
0.0 My friend wanted to go to lunch today. I told her I was busy, but really I just didn't want to go...	1.0 I've done that before when I was just annoyed with them. Don't feel bad!
0.0 Well, I do feel a little guilty, just sitting here on my couch watching tv	1.0 Who cares! I always like to think of satisfying myself first before others!
0.0 So...the sewer line backed up into our house last week. 	1.0 Oh no! That's a smelly situation to be in. What did you end up doing to fix it?
0.0 It was truly disgusting. We had to have a crew of plumbers come in and dig up our yard.	1.0 What a pain! I bet that cost a fortune. Did they end up repairing all the portions of yard that they had to rip up?
0.0 My brother got out of prison yesterday! It felt so good to see him after such a long time.	1.0 That must have been a great reunion! Who was happier, him or you?
0.0 Definitely me, I gave him a big bear hug when he walked out those gates.	1.0 He was lucky to have you waiting there for him!
0.0 The transmission in my car died last week. Such an expensive repair	1.0 Ugh, I hate when unexpected expenses arise.
0.0 Fortunately, my parents offered to loan me the money to fix it. 	1.0 Well, that was nice of them. I hope you take them out to dinner after you pay them back.
0.0 My friend and I both did a low-carb diet last month. She lost 8 pounds. I gained 2! 	1.0 Wow, great for her! I am confused as to how you ended up GAINING though!
0.0 I dunno. Water weight? She looks so good now. I'm really envious. 	1.0 Well, keep at it and you will get where you want to be. It really just comes down to how many calories you take in vs. how many calories you burn per day.
0.0 On a whim today, I bought a scratch off card at 7/11	1.0 Please tell me you won a lot of money.
0.0 Not a lot - $100. But that's $100 more than I had when I woke up this morning. I was so surprised I did one of those annoying girly squeals at the check out counter	1.0 lol That's how I would of reacted too. One hundred dollars can buy you a lot of stuff.
0.0 My kids spilled juice on my brand new white carpet. I told them not to brink food, or drinks in the living room. When will they learn?	1.0 OH NO! That's infuriating. Did the stain come out?
0.0 Yes, but I had to spend extra money to get the carpet shampooed. I gave them a spanking that they will never forget. I'm not putting up with this no more.	1.0 Hopefully they remember
0.0 I had a salad for lunch yesterday, then went shopping at the mall. When I got home around 7pm I discovered I had a HUGE piece of spinach between my front teeth!	1.0 Did you brush it right out?
0.0 I did. But dozen of people had already seen it. I was mortified. No one told me!	1.0 Maybe you could give them a call on the phone and tell them about your feelings?
0.0 My friend invited me to a pool party, but I don't know how to swim. I told her I would think about it.	1.0 You could go to the party. And then learn how to swim!
0.0 I'm not sure, I might just stay in the shallow part of the pool.	1.0 Yea, and you can bring some water toys to play with!
0.0 I went to a wedding this weekend. I've recently lost a ton of weight so I bought a new dress for the occassion. 	1.0 Awesome! I bet you felt proud at what you accomplished. Did you have this goal in mind for a while?
0.0 Yes. I've wanted to be healthier, but I also wanted to look hot and feel confident at this event. 	1.0 How much total weight did you lose, and how long did it take?
0.0 I'm leaving for vacation on Wednesday!	1.0 Thats awesome.  I wish I could go.  Where are you going?
0.0 On a cruise to Havana. I'm so excited!	1.0 Cruises are awesome.  You get to eat as much food as you want.  You'll probably put on like 10 pounds
0.0 I got caught in a huge rainstorm last week. It was a deludge. 	1.0 Aww man, I hope you brought your raincoat.
0.0 Thankfully I had remembered to put an umbrella in my bag before I left the house. 	1.0 That's good, you don't want to get soaked and catch a cold.
0.0 My brother in the army showed up at my football event yesterday. I wasn't expecting him to come. I thought he was still stationed in Iraq.	1.0 That's amazing. You must have been so surprised and happy!
0.0 Totally, I was in shock.	1.0 Did you get a video of it?
0.0 Once, at a Waffle House near Memphis, I heard a man order 15 eggs over-easy. 	1.0 Gee, he must have been really hungry! That's a lot of eggs!
0.0 I stayed to watch to see if he'd eat them all. He did. I was very impressed.	1.0 Wow.. that's unbelievable. I wonder how his cholesterol is. 
0.0 TSA made me pull down my pants in front of everybody at the airport yesterday. They thought I was a bomb threat.	1.0 Oh dang, that really sucks. I can't believe TSA would go that far, it must've been super embarrassing. 
0.0 Yeah, I will never show my face there again.	1.0 Dude, you should definitely report it someone or the company because you could probably get something out of it.
0.0 I rode the largest roller coaster I've ever ridden this summer. 	1.0 Oh yeah, what was it called? I really love roller coasters!
0.0 Millenium Force, in Cedar Point. It was utterly terrifying. 	1.0 I saw that one on TV. It looks absolutely nuts. I hope to visit Cedar Point one day!
0.0 I'm waiting to hear back from a few colleges about scholarships.	1.0 Oh, I hope you get some good news. I am sure it would help you getting aid for college.
0.0 Yes, I think my stats are good. I'm hopeful there will be some good news soon.	1.0 All you can do is be patient and see what happens. I am sure everything will work out for you.
0.0 My best friend is getting married next weekend. I'm in the wedding. 	1.0 That's awesome. I hope it works out for your friend and their fiancee. Are you excited to be there?
0.0 Super excited! These two have been together forever. It's about time they made it legit!	1.0 Well I am sure they appreciate you being a part of their big day. Enjoy the after party!
0.0 I went to a fancy art showing at a gallery last night.	1.0 Wow, that sounds fun. What type of artwork did you see?
0.0 It was watercolors. My neighbor was the artist. I had no idea she did such great work. She also has two toddlers. I have no idea how she manages all of that.	1.0 Gee, she must have her hands full! I hope she does well as an artist!
0.0 I thought I could lift, but my wife upstaged me by benching 150 lbs at the gym the other day. I can only lift 130 lbs.	1.0 Did you feel very emasculated by this?
0.0 No, it actually turned me on. I didn't know she was that strong.	1.0 Yeah, I can see that viewpoint as well. She may end up carrying you to bed next time!
0.0 My son came back from a camping trip last night. I was great to have him safely home again. 	1.0 I'm glad he returned home safe and sound. Did he have fun on the camping trip?
0.0 He did. I'm a worrier, but I need to learn to let go more. 	1.0 My mom was the same way. It's all part of being a parent. I hope to have kids soon too and I worry about stuff concerning them myself!
0.0 I came across my wedding albums the other day and showed them to my kids.	1.0 Oh wow, I bet the emotions of that came back to you.
0.0 Yes, it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband, pre-kids. Very sentimental.	1.0 Yes, those memories are what make life so special.
0.0 I got a car for my birthday, but I kinda knew I was going to get it beforehand because I kept telling my wife I wanted it.	1.0 So, not a surprise, but still nice to get? 
0.0 Yeah, kind of ruined the surprise, but I can always count on my wife to make me feel special.	1.0 That's sweet. 
0.0 I donated $1, 000 to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It's for a great cause that's very important to me.	1.0 Wow, thats very admirable of you.  People who abuse animals are the worst kind of people.
0.0 I agree, we should protect and nurture animals, not abuse them. 	1.0 I have 2 dogs myself and I could never imagine hurting them.  I can't believe there are people out there who think that that is ok. its sick.
0.0 i miss my childhood and living with my parents	1.0 Yeah those were the days. When we had no worries in the world.
0.0 yes indeed.  i wish i had my treehouse back that my dad built for me.  i would live in it.	1.0 That sounds really cool. I always wanted a treehouse but never had a good tree for it.
0.0 i live next to a football field and every football season i hate living here	1.0 Oh yeah, why is that?
0.0 Because they park in my driveway!	1.0 I would have them towed!
0.0 i have signs up this year, so i can do that legally!	1.0 Oh so you have to have a sign up to legally tow them?
0.0 Yes. Which i think is wrong.  If they are on my property i should have the right without the sign.	1.0 Or you could just park behind them so that they would have to knock on your door before you let them out.
0.0 my husband treated me to a week at disney, i had no idea!	1.0 That's awesome. Which Disney park did you go to?
0.0 disney world. it's the only one Ive ever been to .	1.0 Ooh I live pretty close to it. You have a great husband to give you that treat!
0.0 i am pretty happy right now, i don't think i have ever been happier with my life.	1.0 That's good that you found happiness. That's what were all in the pursuit of right?
0.0 Exactly! I used to struggle but i don't anymore	1.0 You are blessed. Make sure to spread the positive energy. 
0.0 My daughter went out of town, but she promised me she wouldn't do anything I wouldn't approve of, and I believe her, so I let her go.	1.0 that's great that you can trust her.  how old?
0.0 Yeah, she's a good kid and hasn't given me any reason to think otherwise. She just turned 18.	1.0 That's great. Be thankful, some people aren't so lucky.
0.0 Man I can't believe I almost bought that thing at Walmart!	1.0 what did you almost buy?
0.0 It was a combination rice-cooker and vegetable steamer.  It looked so good in the ad, but when I got there, it looked cheap and shabby!	1.0 It's hard to find good quality at walmart
0.0 I hope I can find one that lives up to the promise of that ad.  Maybe somwhere else, right?	1.0 I would try target.  good quality stuff there.
0.0 I could try online, but I'd have to buy it first and then see if it's good quality.	1.0 try googling it, and read thru the reviews
0.0 i am trying to sell my house, i hope i can find a buyer	1.0 Finding a buyer can be tough.  You have a good agent?
0.0 I hope i do.  We will see, I know it can take a while.\	1.0 Does it have a good location?  You know the only rule of real estate, right?  Location, Location, Location.
0.0 yes i live behind a school.	1.0 Sounds good.  Definitely should target a family buyer then
0.0 yes, but i will leave that to the listing agent.	1.0 You got a figure in mind for your house or are you letting the agent handle that as well?
0.0 I had to leave my last job because this manager they brought in was such an incompetent doofus.	1.0 Thats never good when you have a bad manager.  What made them so bad?
0.0 He was the "marketing manager" but couldn't market his way out of a paper bag, it was impossible to work with him. Plus he thought he knew everything which made it worse.	1.0 Know it alls are the worst.  Hopefully you are in a better spot now, with a manager who cares.
0.0 i am concerned about my father	1.0 Oh no! What's wrong with your dad?
0.0 he is old, and he lives alone.  i just worry because he is getting old.  he gets on ok, but i don't know how much longer.	1.0 Aw, I'm so sorry to hear that. It's not easy to watch our parents age. 
0.0 no it's not, but hopefully our kids will do the same for us some day.	1.0 We can surely hope! 
0.0 My neighbor asked me to watch over his dog. I told him he could trust me, but he escaped and ran away.	1.0 That must have made you feel terrible. Were you able to find the dog?
0.0 I feel so bad. I forgot to lock the gate. No, but I put up a lot of posters, so hopefully I find him before my neighbor comes back.	1.0 I sincerely hope you can find him! But I bet your neighbor will understand it was just a mistake and you didn't do it on purpose.
0.0 I used to have this obnoxious neighbor who stayed up all night playing League of Legends, he drove me nuts screaming into his headset all hours of the day and night.	1.0 Doesn't he understand that people have to go to work in the morning?
0.0 His parents paid his bills so no, he didn't understand that sadly. I tried talking to him about it but clearly he didn't get the picture as he kept doing it.	1.0 You might have to file a noise complaint with the police.
0.0 i have a new job offer, but im not sure if i should take it	1.0 What is causing you to question whether it's the right thing for you or not?
0.0 well, it is retail.  ive done retail and it is not fun.	1.0 Yeah, I've done that as well.  It can definitely be a hard job, considering dealing with the public, hours during holiday seasons, etc.. But sometimes if the pay is good, it can outweigh some of the negatives.
0.0 So this one time I walked in on my cat using the toilet by himself. He just taught himself to do it, I had no idea how or why but it was pretty cool.	1.0 lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time
0.0 I know which movie you're talking about! I think they actually had to train that cat to do it. Mine just... learned.	1.0 wow , i would love to have a cat like yours 
0.0 I went to a concert by myself because all my friends were too busy doing other things.	1.0 Aww thats too bad that no one else could go.  What concert was it?
0.0 It was a Marilyn Manson concert. I was even dancing by myself.	1.0 haha that must have been a crazy concert! 
0.0 This friend of mine is constantly job hopping, I don't even know what she does technically but she seems to get good jobs so easily, whereas when I left my last job I could barely get interviews.	1.0 Sometimes that depends on the industry. If she works in ones that have high turnover it's not a big of a deal as, say, an administrative job
0.0 She's in banking so there are definitely a lot of available jobs. And there seems to be a lot of turnover so you're probably right.	1.0 Well, I'm not entirely sure about the banking side but I wonder what she's looking for. Perhaps a small vs big bank culture
0.0 I am ready to start renovating the rest of my house.	1.0 OOO I love doing that, but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it.  What room are you going to be working on?
0.0 I finished my kitchen, so the next room is going to be my family room.  Just painting it really. 	1.0 Still, a new color can definitely brighten up a space and make it feel all new!
0.0 This morning I woke up and I was in such a good mood that I just started singing in the shower.	1.0 That's awesome!  I wish I could wake up that way every morning.  Did something specific make you feel that way?
0.0 I don't know, I think it was because I had a dream about marrying Scarlett Johansson.	1.0 Ha!!  Well I've woken up from a dream and been mad at my husband because of something he did in my dream - I guess it can go the other way too!
0.0 I went through my closet the other day and found all these old writings and drawings I did when I was in elementary school. It was fun remembering being that little, how different the world was.	1.0 I've done that before... I enjoyed it too! I love looking back at old pictures and stuff
0.0 Did your parents save a lot of your school work like mine did? I'm surprised how much my mom kept!	1.0 Some of it but my grandma did save a lot.  I plan on doing that with my kids
0.0 For my birthday last year, a coworker gave me cheese. It sounds ridiculous but I was touched by her thoughtfulness. I love cheese!	1.0 I love cheese too! What kind of cheese was it?
0.0 Smoked gouda, one of my favorites! I ate it all in a day haha	1.0 Gouda is great! Do you like prosciutto too?
0.0 My cat had really bad breath so I took her in to the dentist. It turned out almost all of her teeth needed to be pulled, poor thing was in so much pain.	1.0 Aww poor baby, hopefully shes doing fine now.
0.0 She's doing great, thanks! It was a tough recovery for a few days but then you could tell she felt SO much better.	1.0 That's great to hear. You have one tough cat.
0.0 When I was a kid, I remember telling my mom to take me to McDonald's, just so I could get the toy in my Happy Meal. I didn't even care about the food.	1.0 Ha, I used to do that too. But I was almost always disappointed by the toy once I actually got it.
0.0 Right? but when you collected them all there was no greater feeling.	1.0 True! McDonald's was my first job when I was 14 and I remember being stoked I could now collect ALL the toys even if I didn't play with them!
0.0 I'm so nervous. I had a job interview the other day and haven't heard back yet.	1.0 Did they tell you when you may hear back from them?
0.0 They said within the week, I know it's only been a few days but I'm excited about the opportunity!	1.0 I pray they get in touch with you soon and that's is an affirmative on the job!  I know  how nerve-wracking waiting can be though - I hope you get it!
0.0 Unfortunately, I accidentally sent an email to a coworker essentially complaining about her attitude. I really wanted to dig myself in a hole and never come out.	1.0 Arghhhhhhhhh! I soooo feel for you and have been there. Have y'all had the chance to talk about it? (Or do you even want to?)
0.0 I've kind of avoided her a bit. I'm trying to come up with an apology that feels heartfelt. It's a horrible feeling!	1.0 I hear you. Maybe humor might help? Like "okay, so *this* is awkward....can we talk about that email?" Heartfelt apologies go a long way, and even if she doesn't respond -- you'll feel better for trying.
0.0 I went to a restaurant and the waitress put things on our bill that I did not order. 	1.0 Are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill?
0.0 It had everything we ordered plus a couple things at the bottom we didn't order.	1.0 I would have complained.
0.0 Since most of my family is either dead or lives a few states away, I usually spend Thanksgiving alone. It sucks sometimes.	1.0 Ohh, I feel sorry for you
0.0 Oh don't feel bad, I live a lovely life and have many friends. It's just that they usually go home to their own families that time of year.	1.0 Ohh, that's bad. You can always skype your family!
0.0 I spent the entire other weekend cleaning my apartment. It sucked at the time but it was so nice when I was done to just chill out and watch TV.	1.0 Yes, I feel you. Cleaning sucks, but after all that hard work, the results are amazing!
0.0 Right? It's so rewarding when you're finished and everything smells good. I love that feeling.	1.0 Me too! You seem just like me!
0.0 My husband and I closed on our first house last week!	1.0 That sounds very exciting! What kind of planning did you put into such an achievement?
0.0 It is! Lots of blood, sweat and tears - and lots of phone calls and signing things, haha. We can't wait to move in!	1.0 That's so cool! I wish you the very best and hope that the blood sweat and tears turns into happiness, joy and fun times!
0.0 my daughter moved to California and a few months later she got in a car accident and was on the other side of the country so there was nothing I could immediately do.	1.0 Are there any other family members out there that could help her?
0.0 No. She asked her friend to call me after it happened but wasn't able to tell me many details.	1.0 Wow, I hope that she was able to work things out. Not the best way to start living somewhere far from home, but I'm sure she figured something out.
0.0 Recently I was contacted by my former company, begging to get me back. I felt really good about the salary negotiation since I knew they needed me.	1.0 That's great! I am happy for you!
0.0 Thanks, I'm happy about it. I only have to work a few hours a week, it's pretty amazing.	1.0 Yeah, and they are paying you good enough. You are a luckiest person!
0.0 i was shocked to learn that i had been called to serve on a jury !	1.0 i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule 
0.0 yes i am not looking forward to it.  ive heard that its just awful.	1.0 same thing i heard too , really long and boring being there against your will 
0.0 My dog died this past December and I've had a really hard time getting over it. She was our family pet.	1.0 I am so sorry to hear that. I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past, so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.
0.0 She really was a wonderful pet. We just got a puppy recently, which is the same breed as the one who passed away. She's bringing some light back into our lives. 	1.0 Aww that's great! What breed? 
0.0 The worst day of my life was when I was 8 months pregnant with our first child and I started bleeding like crazy.	1.0 Oh no! that sounds so scary. was everything ok?
0.0 Yes, thankfully everything turned out fine. I had to spend 3 weeks in the hospital though!	1.0 Good I'm glad to hear that.  That's a long time.  Hospitals scare me, I can't imagine being there for that long
0.0 my doggie recently passed away	1.0 I'm so sorry to hear that! Hopefully he or she wasn't in too much pain at the end.
0.0 no i don't think so, but it was violent.  she was run over by a car.  	1.0 Oh my gosh that's horrible. I hope they caught the person who hit her!
0.0 The other day I woke up and without looking I stepped in warm cat vomit.	1.0 oh man, that's gross! at least it was vomit and not something else.
0.0 Yeah it was pretty gross but one of my cats is pretty pukey, I should have known better and watched where I was walking.	1.0 how many cats do have?
0.0 My dog died last year. 	1.0 Aw, I am so sorry. How long did you have your dog for?
0.0 About 5 years. He was a rescue.	1.0 They say dogs are mans best friend. 
0.0 That's true. He was definitely mine.	1.0 What kind of dog was he?
0.0 He was a pit and lab mix.	1.0 Nice, I have an australian shepherd. He follows me around everywhere. 
0.0 The worst phone call I ever got in my life was when I was told my dad only had a few weeks left to live.	1.0 Oh no. That's terrible. I lost my dad five years ago, I know how terrible that feels.
0.0 I'm sorry to hear that. I'm going on just over two years. Never thought it would happen to us.	1.0 Neither did we. He seemed so healthy, and then within weeks he was so sick he couldn't even talk. I miss him every day, 
0.0 The other day I checked my email and a former client I did some freelance work had emailed me a gift card out of the blue! I was happy.	1.0 surprise gifts are always fun.
0.0 Very! I decided since it was surprise money I would waste it on something fun.	1.0 that sounds like a well deserved plan.
0.0 I remember the first I went to a theme park.  I had been planning on the way there not to go on any roller coasters, but just being there changed my mind quickly.	1.0 Oh man, I can relate, that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment
0.0 Exactly.  I just saw how much fun it looked and I thought to myself I should just live a little.  It's not often you get to have experiences like that.	1.0 Life is full of experiences like that, they seem scary from the outside, but once you relax you get swept away
0.0 i lost $100 cash somewhere. I have looked everywhere and i can't find it	1.0 that sounds prettty bad!
0.0 yes, i have retraced my steps and i can't find it.  hopefully i will find it when i need it the most.	1.0 I cannot imagine if something like that happens to me. I would be trying very hard to find it.
0.0 i have looked everywhere. it's so frustrating.	1.0 Sometimes by remembering all the places that you have been in the past two days can help. I will try that!
0.0 I really hate when people let their kids run wild in public. I do believe kids should be kids but there is a time and place for it.	1.0 I agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think. 
0.0 The worst is when they're screaming at them rather than just speaking to them calmly. 	1.0 The frustration they go through well at least we don't have to take the kids or parents home.
0.0 I wanted to go and get the tissue that was on sale was so bummed it was sold out.	1.0 What store were you at? 
0.0 I was going to Walgreen's and they was out and the sale began today. 	1.0 Could you get a rain check? That is a bummer? 
0.0 it was my birthday and felt like no one really cared 	1.0 Aw man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make you feel better? 
0.0 thanks! my coworker went out on lunch break and bought my favorite ice cream cake!	1.0 Ice cream cake is my favorite! I'm glad you're feeling better haha. You have a really nice co-worker.
0.0 yes she is honestly the greatest 	1.0 That's really awesome! She sounds like a great person to work with.
0.0 I completely ate the last cupcake even though I know my husband will want one when he gets home. Should I go get some more?	1.0 Oh, I know how that goes. My husband loves sweets, but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it It will get eaten right then. Getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them. lol
0.0 Right! It's almost like, you knew this was going to happen. I feel terrible but it was so good lol. I'll get him some more tomorrow!	1.0 That's probably what I would do also. It won't kill him to wait another day.
0.0 I was at the store the other day and the lady ahead of me had no idea how to use self checkout, I wish she would have used the regular line instead of holding everyone up.	1.0 Oh I hate when that happens. we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines.
0.0 Exactly! I wasn't in a hurry or anything but it felt so inconsiderate.	1.0 Hopefully the person learned what they had to do so they don't hold the line up in the future.
0.0 When I was in high school there was a girl I had liked for a long time that ended up dating my best friend.	1.0 Oh man, that must have hurt. Did she know you had feelings for her?
0.0 Yes. But at the time she was unavailable. Then when she wasn't spoken for my "friend" asked her out.	1.0 Sounds like your friend broke bro code, that was kind of scummy.
0.0 I had mentioned to my friend one day that my computer was pretty much on its way out.  Some time later I found that he had sent me the money to buy a new one.	1.0 Wow! What a nice friend. I wish my friends did that
0.0 Yea I was really thankful and appreciative for it.  He's like a brother to me.	1.0 That's great. It's nice to have people so close to you. It really helps in bad times
0.0 I cried so hard seeing my baby girl walk across the stage at her VPK graduation.	1.0 That must of been a proud moment for you as a father.  She's all grown up and out in the real world now
0.0 Yes this is a new milestone and now she get's to see what real school is all about with all age groups.	1.0 That's awesome, she'll have a great time and learn a lot i'm sure!
0.0 I entered a raffle at a local fair and actually won $1000.	1.0 Wow! What are you gonna do with the winnings?
0.0 Oh they are long gone, lol. Bills to pay and all.	1.0 Bills do take up a lot, don't they.
0.0 One time I moved into a new apartment, it was this big loft in a converted warehouse. I had this automatic soap dispenser that went nuts on me and made this really scary sound, I thought the place was haunted!	1.0 Oh my gosh! thats funny.  was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted?
0.0 Haha yeah it was pretty funny once I realized what the spooky sound coming from the kitchen was.	1.0 How did you discover exactly what it was?
0.0 I have a fear for roller coaster but I let my siblings talk me into getting on one last night.	1.0 Roller coasters are scary for me. How was it for you?
0.0 Fun but scary I couldn't wait for it to end lol had my eyes closed most of the ride. 	1.0 I'm the same way haha. But how was it fun if you have your eyes closed the whole time?!
0.0 I had to put my cat down a few years ago, she was old and in kidney failure.	1.0 I am so sorry to hear that. I'm sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys.
0.0 She had a good life. She was actually my mom's cat, she came to live with me when my mom died.	1.0 You went through a lot of losses.
0.0 Someone buggy was in the way at Publix and I tripped and fell in the aisle. 	1.0 That sounds painful, I hope you were okay after your fall. 
0.0 I was ok just the look on m face let you know I was ashamed lol I turned red instantly. 	1.0 Yeah i bet that was really embarrassing, but I'm glad you're okay. 
0.0 I applied for a job one time where I was one of 4 people being considered for it and had to wait a week to find out if I got it.	1.0 Oh boy!  That's always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know. Did you get it?!!
0.0 I did get it! If I was a praying kind of guy I would have done so every day. I was o nervous.	1.0 Amazing! Congratulation! Prayer is always a good thing to do! That is so incredible.  Are you enjoying the job?
0.0 I remember being younger and waiting on Christmas Day to unwrap presents.  There were a lot of things I wanted that year.	1.0 I remember those times. Did you get what you wanted?
0.0 Well I was really looking forward to the Super Nintendo.  It had just come out that year and everyone my age wanted one.	1.0 The super nintendo is a classic. What is your favorite game?
0.0 I fell off my bike the other day in front of a bunch of people. It was kind of humiliating.	1.0 Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I would feel the same way but you just have to think...who cares what others think!  If they can't have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them.  Did you get hurt?
0.0 You're right, the other people probably hardly noticed. And no, thankfully I was OK! Unless you count the bruise on my ego.	1.0 I bet they didn't.  I like to look at experiences as part of our journey and teaches us to have compassion for others in similar situations.  So glad you're alright! Hope you own a helmet!
0.0 This one year right after I moved to the east coast we had this scary hurricane warning. I went ahead and stocked up on all the basics; batteries, canned goods, beer. I was set!	1.0 How'd the hurricane go?
0.0 Wouldn't you know it totally missed my city. I was a little let down to be honest, though glad we were safe.	1.0 Thank goodness. Hurricanes are no joke.
0.0 I was going on a trip and couldn't take my dog so I had to board him and I was so worried about it.	1.0 Was he okay?
0.0 He was fine. I just didn't know how he was going to handle it, he is a very nervous dog.	1.0 Well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it. I would be afraid just because he is afraid.
0.0 That's true. He was a rescue and sometimes I wonder if he was treated in a bad way and thats why he is like that.	1.0 Maybe so. It's good he has a good home now.
0.0 I like to think he does. I just hope he is as happy as he makes me.	1.0 I bet he is. Don't worry
0.0 I usually food prep for the week it is so much easier.	1.0 That is a great idea
0.0 Yes it works out great saves me money and keeps my scheduled arranged and on track. 	1.0 Saving money is important
0.0 My daughter graduated high school as a straight A student last year	1.0 That's amazing! You must be so proud.
0.0 Oh I am. It's nice to know that I raised a child with a good head on her shoulders.	1.0 She's also a hard worker.
0.0 Yesterday my Lyft driver offered to carry my groceries up to my apartment. I thought that was super nice, there were A LOT of bags.	1.0 That was very sweet they don't have to actually do that.
0.0 It was sweet. And I told him not to worry about it, I didn't want to hold him up. 	1.0 Good to know there is still kind people in the world.
0.0 I got some pink roses at work last week I was so happy.	1.0 That's awesome! Who were they from?
0.0 My husband but I didn't expect it I was so surprised they was a just because gift.	1.0 That was really sweet of him, maybe he just wanted you to know you're loved.
0.0 I am about to leave on a 17 hour car trip with my husband, our four kids, and 2 dogs. I think I have everything ready to go though	1.0 You can never be too prepared! I am sure you have got everything.
0.0 I hope so. I even portioned out each meal for our dogs in little plastic bags to make sure we have enough. 	1.0 That was very smart thinking on your part. Have fun on your trip!
0.0 I sent an email I shouldn't have sent. I'd been drinking and totally should have saved it rather than sending it when I did.	1.0 We all do things we regret when drinking
0.0 True. The funny thing was I obsessed over it for days, worrying I made a mistake. And absolutely nothing happened! I worried for nothing.	1.0 Thats usually how it goes
0.0 A few years ago I decided to move cross-country. It was kind of terrifying taking a huge leap like that with no job and hardly knowing anyone here.	1.0 You definitely took a leap of faith there. How'd it go?
0.0 It definitely has had its ups and downs but overall I'm really glad I did it. I don't think I'll be doing it again any time soon that's for sure.	1.0 hahaha I definitely admire your courage to have done that.
0.0 I'm going back to school I am going to stick to my goal and don't stop until I get my degree.	1.0 I wish you luck
0.0 Thanks I am super excited I know I will have a great outcome I have goals to meet.	1.0 I am sure you will meet them
0.0 I spent my birthday last year alone. I expected my boyfriend to make plans but nope.	1.0 That's disappointing. What happened? Did he just not do anything?
0.0 Yeah, he acted like it was just a normal day, it was so weird. Maybe I'm getting too old to make a big deal out of birthdays anyway.	1.0 I would have been disappointed, too. 
0.0 I get so annoyed when it rains I had plans for a family cookout but it started thundering and lightening such a bummer. 	1.0 Oh no that is a total bummer. It's especially common in the summer months.
0.0 Yes it's the worse especially in Florida it's sunny one day and pouring down raining the next. 	1.0 Oh right, I spent some time in Florida when I was younger and I remember it being so unpredictable. Just gotta keep an umbrella all the time lol.
0.0 I went to a book release party yesterday.	1.0 Cool. Was it interesting?
0.0 Yes. It was a good friend of mine. She got a novel published! She also has four small kids. I'm not sure how she does it all.	1.0 Good for her! Moms get a lot done lol
0.0 My best friend is moving across the country next week. 	1.0 ARe you happy or sad?
0.0 Sad. I will miss her terribly 	1.0 I bet. I she moving school or a job?
0.0 My job recognized me for my hard work I was thankful and surprised I just love my job.	1.0 Oh cool that's great! What were you doing that they recognised?
0.0 For over exceeding and helping all staff when in need, I am always just helpful but was happy to get noticed for my hard work.	1.0 Awesome. What is your job?
0.0 I got a random email this morning with a $120 gift voucher	1.0 Wow was it a scam or was it legit?
0.0 I was really sure it was a scam but it turned out it was a prize for a survey I had submitted a few weeks ago!	1.0 That is so good congratulations you are lucky what are you going to use it for?
0.0 There was an "incident" at the gym today.	1.0 Oh no, what happened?
0.0 I finished a fabulous workout, then promptly fell UP the stairs on my way to the locker room. In front of everyone. I was mortified.	1.0 Oh no! But that happens (it has happened to me several times). At least you had the great workout!
0.0 After four long, broke months of looking, I finally got offered a job today!	1.0 That's great. Are you excited?
0.0 Yes, and incredibly happy. I was getting really worried about the bills. 	1.0 Is it your dream job? Then you should really be happy.
0.0 I had an email telling me I had a $120 gift voucher this morning	1.0 Was it real?
0.0 Haha that was my first thought too. It actually was!	1.0 That's awesome. What are you going to buy?
0.0 Thanks! No idea actually, it's for a department store here in Australia	1.0 Australia. I hope to go there some day
0.0 You definitely should! It's a really cool place, but so hard to see everything because it's so big	1.0 I bet, I will get there one day
0.0 I knocked over a clothing display on the sidewalk outside of a boutique the other day when I was riding my bike. I should have gone back to pick it up but kept going.	1.0 I've done the same thing before. I'm sure you weren't a bother
0.0 I hope not. Now that you mention it I'm sure it happens all the time.	1.0 Yeah and they really should be better about how they place their racks
0.0 I was waiting for a while for a video game to come out.  When it finally did it wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be.	1.0 That has happend to me too.
0.0 I got my hopes up too much. I should wait for reviews to come out before I rush out and buy next time.	1.0 You can always sell them if you buy discs. Cant do anything with a download though
0.0 That's very true.  Which is why I prefer physical discs most of the time.	1.0 We live and we learn lol
0.0 The other day I was listening to Spotify and put U2's Achtung Baby on. It reminds me of pre middle school days.	1.0 I used to love that band
0.0 Yeah they were great back in the day. I can't comment on their new stuff, I haven't listened to any of it in years.	1.0 I have not either
0.0 So the cable repair guy was supposed to show up between 8:30 and 12:30 on Friday. Guess when he showed up....	1.0 Probably at 4 or 5! lol
0.0 You got it. 5:00. WHY does this still happen? I wasted the whole day waiting. 	1.0 No idea! I haven't had cable in so long! I would HATE that and they always over charge! Don't they have a rule that theres no service fee if they are late?
0.0 I got a random email telling me I had won a gift card	1.0 Was it real because I get those every day lol
0.0 Haha yeah it actually turned out to be real! It was for $120	1.0 I could do so much with $120. Im jealous lol
0.0 We had a near-disaster at our house today.	1.0 oh no! what happened?
0.0 My older son called from the bathroom that we were out of toilet paper. It seemed...um...urgent....Fortunately, we had an emergency stash in the laundry room.	1.0 ah, crisis averted! that could have been a lot worse
0.0 We went to our favorite Italian restaurant for dinner tonight.	1.0 Was it good? I hate when your favorite place disappoints.
0.0 It was good! It always is. I had my "usual" pasta and just enough wine to feel relaxed, but not loopy. It was a good way to end a Sunday.	1.0 That's great. Sundays are supposed to be breezy
0.0 I didn't have a pen while returning a rental car to an unattended location	1.0 Hm, that sounds interesting. I'm not really familiar with this kind of situation, since I've never had to rent a car. What exactly happened, or what did that mean?
0.0 Yeah I was travelling in the US and they just had a drop box where you put the keys and a form in. Luckily I asked a stranger who was passing by and they gave me a really nice pen to keep	1.0 Oh, so it was no big deal? At least you cared enough to stop someone and ask them about it. No harm, no foul.
0.0 I recently got an email from my old company hinting that they wanted me back. It was kind of exciting, I really wanted it to work out.	1.0 I bet that was a nice feeling
0.0 It definitely was. The money is great and I get to set my own hours!	1.0 That sounds perfect
0.0 I have a dentist appointment first thing tomorrow morning. 	1.0 The dentist makes me a bit nervous
0.0 It makes me VERY nervous. I hate it. I'll probably barely sleep tonight because of it. 	1.0 Well at least think about the fact that it's a good thing to go to the dentist!
0.0 I got back from vacation last week and found a huge dent in my car. 	1.0 That is awful, did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number? 
0.0 No. They just hit it and left the airport parking lot. I'm pretty incensed. 	1.0 You should ask the airport people if they have any security footage of the parking lot, maybe they can track down the car.
0.0 I went to the fanciest dinner party the other night. It was  eight amazing courses of food!	1.0 What kind of food was there?
0.0 Really intricate things - souffles and such. I was very impressed.	1.0 It is nice that you enjoyed it.
0.0 I saw a mouse run across my kitchen last night. I woke everyone up with my screaming.	1.0 Oh man.  That would of startled me too.  What did you do after?
0.0 Stood on the couch and screamed some more! I do not do rodents. I'm having my son handle it. I think he's putting out traps tonight.	1.0 Well I can understand your nervousness.  I probably would be on guard as well
0.0 My kitty that I had since she was a kitten passed away. She was only four years old.	1.0 Oh that is tough.  It is hard when our pets pass away.
0.0 It really is. She was the first pet that was really "mine". She brought a lot of happiness to my life!	1.0 It is like losing a family member isn't it.  Well, just think of all the good times and be thankful.
0.0 I had a test the other day and I'm pretty sure I aced it. I studied for like a week!	1.0 That's great! I never really studied much so I could have done better on my tests
0.0 Same here. I never had to study for high school but when I hit college, it was a wakeup call.	1.0 Oh yes. But, I found that getting involved in clubs along with a major I liked actually allowed me to spend less time studying and more time learning for fun. It's a subtle, but important diffeence
0.0 So all my friends went on vacation last week :(	1.0 Judging by the :(, I'm assuming you didn't get to join them?
0.0 Yeah, we were supposed to go but I couldn't get off work. I got to see all the pictures on Facebook though, ha! So envious.	1.0 I would be envious too.  Perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling :D
0.0 Sounds like a plan :)	1.0 I hope where ever you go, you visit someplace amazing!
0.0 Man I am stuffed.  I found a new pizza joint in town.	1.0 That is nice. Do you like a lot pizza?
0.0 Yeah I definitely like a lot of pizza.  This place had a all you can eat buffet.  I ate my fill of pizza!	1.0 You are lucky.
0.0 Man I couldn't get any sleep last night.	1.0 Were you worried about something? What was keeping you up?
0.0 There was something scratching on my window.  I was pretty nervous.	1.0 Hopefully you had a lock on them, you can never be too safe.
0.0 One year for our anniversary, an iPad showed up at my office. My boyfriend had ordered it and timed it so arrived on our exact anniversary. I didn't expect it at all!	1.0 Dang really! Sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents.
0.0 He's generous yeah but I wouldn't call it "showering." He's just good about knowing what I need!	1.0 That means that he is always listening and paying attention to you!
0.0 I used to enjoy cold showers in the morining.	1.0 I have never tried a cold shower? What is it like?
0.0 It's very cold and refreshing, wakes you up instantly.	1.0 I bet it does wake you up right away. I guess I should try that sometime if I oversleep. lol !
0.0 My neighbor refuses to clean up after her dog and it's infuriating.	1.0 wow that is very rude of her
0.0 It really is. I'm not sure what to do though besides reporting her to the HOA. Any suggestion?	1.0 No I have never dealt with a rude person like that that lives near me
0.0 What else do we need, just a sunny bench and some chips.	1.0 I totally agree. That actually sounds really good rihgt now.
0.0 So lets go, I'll meet you outside in an hour. 	1.0 Sounds fun. Ill be ready. Hope were going to the beach thats closest to us!
0.0 I am looking forward for tomorrow. 	1.0  I will be expecting to see you there.
0.0 Yes, tomorrow as well as today are such a nice places. 	1.0 Having positive attitude always succeed. Keep it up.
0.0 I was walking around town yesterday and saw a girl with crazy hairstyle.	1.0 Interesting.  What was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this?
0.0 It was...Dandelion. 	1.0 Is that a reference to the color of the hair, the shape or something else?
0.0 Man I felt good when I applied for my job!	1.0 How did it go? That's an anxiety-inducing but hopeful situation!
0.0 No I was very assured in my interview.  I got the job, probably because of my attitude.	1.0 Congratulations! Enjoy the new gig! Good things happen to good people.
0.0 I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.	1.0 Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly, once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality. 
0.0 It can be, but personality can't make up for incomptence either.	1.0 I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't, maybe they aren't good employers.
0.0 I flipped through my high school yearbooks the other day for the first time in a long time. I can't believe how much time has passed.	1.0 Time does fly really fast. I just turned 30 and it feels like I was just a teenager yesterday!
0.0 Enjoy it, your 30s go by really fast. I'm clinging desperately to the last few years of mine myself.	1.0 I'm sure it will. At least it gets us to enjoy life more and focus on the moment.
0.0 It's very strange when you meet somebody you know, in the middle of a megalopolis. 	1.0 Yeah, it's like a small world.
0.0 Exactly, how does it even work?	1.0 I think it is merely a coincidence.
0.0 Small thing in life used to make me shed tears.	1.0 Indeed they can. Is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about?
0.0 Yes, things like great classical music for example. 	1.0 Oh, I see. I thought that some other bad things happening in your personal life are making you cry
0.0 We have to stay positive through all the things that happen in the world. 	1.0 I completely agree. We must have positive thoughts at all times. 
0.0 Yes, that's a good start.	1.0 Our thoughts are were everything starts. Mindset is so important. 
0.0 Someone my husband used to work with got a promotion and a really big raise.	1.0 That's awesome!  What do they do?
0.0 They work in the oil field. My husband left the company they both worked for and I can't help but think if he still worked their he would have gotten a raise too.	1.0 That would be nice, but it's never good to dwell on things like that instead of looking toward the future.
0.0 Last week driving to work, I got pulled over for speeding.	1.0 That sucks. How fast were you driving?
0.0 Only a couple miles over. It's always a terrible thing to see those lights in your mirror.	1.0 I hate getting pulled over too. Especailly for something silly like being a couple of miles an hour over the speed limit
0.0 I haven't drank beer in almost a year, but yesterday I relapsed. I feel like such a loser.	1.0 Oh man, I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not a loser though! Just take one day at a time. If you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow
0.0 I just can't believe I gave in to the pressure. Oh well, yeah your right. I'll start by taking baby steps.	1.0 Don't be so hard on yourself. We are all humans, we make mistakes. 
0.0 My neighbor is remodeling his house, which I hate, because they start at 5:30 in the morning.	1.0 That is probably so annoying
0.0 I have a 3 year old, so he wakes up at 5:30 because of all the hammering going on.	1.0 That really sucks. How long will it be going on?
0.0 My wife told me she's pregnant the other day. I was baffled by the news because the doctor told us she only had a ten percent chance of having a baby.	1.0 Wow.  That's either really lucky or unlucky, depending on what you want.  Are you wanting kids?
0.0 Yeah, it just came at an unexpected time. I really want a little boy.	1.0 Well, then congratulations!  I wish you the best of luck, and enjoy this time! :)
0.0 I went to see a movie last night. I wasn't really able to enjoy it though.	1.0 Why not?
0.0 There was this couple sitting two rows in front of me.... they just wouldn't shut up.	1.0 Oh man! That is why I watch movies at home. It's just more comfortable.
0.0 I saw a psychiatrist for the first time yesterday. It was alright, but I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first.	1.0 I have considered it myself but feel the same as you. Will you go back again? 
0.0 I might. It just makes me a little uneasy having to share personal information with a total stranger.	1.0 right, i feel you but maybe it will be good to get it all out!! 
0.0 My mom called me about a year ago and told me she had cancer.	1.0 Is she doing okay now?
0.0 Yes, she had a really difficult 6 months and then things started improving. 	1.0 great, I am very glad to hear she is getting better!
0.0 I was very pleased to get this job	1.0 What is the job?
0.0 I got the job has an software Analysis and that was aim	1.0 Well congrats then, I am sure that is not easy
0.0 I was so angry, I threw a bottle of water!	1.0 What caused that to happen?
0.0 A server went down and I didn't get paid for my work :(	1.0 Oh gosh, hopefully it doesnt happen next time
0.0 i felt nostalgic looking through old photos today	1.0 What were the photos of?
0.0 just old family photos	1.0 It is good to have those and look at once in awhile
0.0 A couple months ago, my wife and I got divorced.	1.0 I am sorry to hear that, what happened?
0.0 We just grew apart I guess. House seems so empty with her and the kids gone.	1.0 Did you try therapy at all or counseling?
0.0 We can't afford to live in our home anymore	1.0 Why is that?
0.0 We're poor, and bills are adding up	1.0 I am sorry to hear that, I hope things improve for you a ton!
0.0 Boy, it's been a lot of owrk	1.0 Sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us ... they are many
0.0 What sort of things?	1.0 I interpret the difficulties
0.0 What sort of difficulties/	1.0 the lack of humor
0.0 Ah, it's no joke is it	1.0 Ok
0.0 Last year, my father passed away.	1.0 Oh goodness, I am so sorry to hear that. Was it sudden?
0.0 Yeah, he developed a stage 4 glioma in his brain that could not be removed.	1.0 That is awful and very sorry you had to go through that. I work at a cancer hospital so I can't imagine going through that with a loved one.
0.0 i feel nostalgic going through old boxes in my basement	1.0 What kind of stuff is in there?
0.0 just old sports uniforms and toys and stuff like that	1.0 Oh okay, I love going through my old stuff too, it is really fun
0.0 I have plans so go to the beach with my wife for a week next month	1.0 That sounds so fun!
0.0 I cant wait! we have been looking forward to going back since our honeymoon.	1.0 I hope you both have tons of fun!
0.0 I'm so glad my health is good	1.0 that's great! I'm glad to hear that. we often take our health for granted.
0.0 We do, and don't do enough to take care of it	1.0 i'm one of those people. Eat junk food even though i know it's not good for me
0.0 Oh man. I can't believe I made that mistake at work today.	1.0 Uh OH what happened
0.0 I was giving a presentation on the project that I'm working on, and I overlooked something simple.... one of my coworkers called me out on it. How embarrassing.	1.0 Oh no, well mistakes do happen, it will be behind you in a few days
0.0 I certainly hope so. The sooner everyone forgets about this, the better.	1.0 Exactly good luck
0.0 I love to see old stuff from when I was a kid	1.0 Oh yeah? What kind of old stuff?
0.0 Old metal lunch boxes like Charlies Angels speed buggy ect	1.0 I always liked those old lunch boxes myself. Do you have a favorite?
0.0 Hong Kong Phooey lol	1.0 Nice! I loved that show when I was a kid. I never had the lunch box though.
0.0 It's time to move!	1.0 Oh, OK!  WHere are you moving to?
0.0 Another house, it's closer to school	1.0 That's good!  That will make your life much easier!  Congratulations!
0.0 So there's a girl that I've been talking to lately... I'm thinking about asking her out.	1.0 That's exciting. Do you have a plan for a date for when she says yes?
0.0 Yeah, I already have it all planned out. We get along really well, so I'm sure she's going to say yes.	1.0 What all is on the agenda for the date?
0.0 I've finally finished writing the book that I've been working on for the last few months.	1.0 Great. Are you going to get it published?
0.0 Definitely! I'm pretty happy with this one, can't wait to get it published.	1.0 What is the book about?
0.0 To say anything about it at all would be giving too much away!	1.0 Boo. What genre?
0.0 Oh man. I was cleaning out my fridge, and found something unpleasant.	1.0 OH NO that is the worst! Did you clean it up?
0.0 Well I threw it out. It was some unidentifiable stuff in a plastic container. It had been in there for months, I think.	1.0 You shoudl write the date on stuff to prevent that from happening again
0.0 My little one got injured	1.0 Oh no! What happened?
0.0 She fell off a kitchen stool	1.0 Ouch. I hope she's okay.
0.0 Whew. I had a lot of housework to get done, but it's finally finished.	1.0 thats good, its always a good feeling after
0.0 Yeah, I'm pretty happy. Now I can just sit back and relax.	1.0 thats the way to do it
0.0 i was delighted with how well my nephew did at his little league game	1.0 Did his team win?
0.0 yes	1.0 That's great news! I bet you're so proud.
0.0 My clothing is making me crazy	1.0 Oh no!  Why are they driving you crazy?
0.0 They're totally itchy	1.0 That is no good!  I guess it is time for you to go shopping!
0.0 i admired the way my nieghbors helped each other out after a storm	1.0 Storms are the worst and destroy so much.
0.0 they are horrible, luckily this one wasnt deadly or too destructive	1.0 My family went through a big storm a few years ago.
0.0 I got a terrible phone call yesterday...	1.0 what happened on the phone call?
0.0 I found out that my brother died.	1.0 I am so sorry about that.
0.0 Ugh, my cat keeps attacking my foot.	1.0 Has it made any scratch marks?
0.0 Nah, he just keeps running up, grabbing and biting, then running away. It was cute and funny at first, now it's just irritating.	1.0 Have you tried disciplining him in anyway
0.0 Yeah, I've sprayed him with a water bottle a few times, it doesn't seem to work very well.	1.0 Sounds like it's time for a crate.
0.0 it is frustrating waiting on hold to speak to a human	1.0 Yea, I hate calling ATT or Verizon they take forever to get on the phone.
0.0 it is so annoying!	1.0 I think as we get smarter, it will get better.
0.0 I didn't expect to get anything for my birthday from my fiance since he's been broke, but he gave me a bouquet of flowers and took me out to eat still!	1.0 Wow!  Sounds like a keeper right there!  That must have been a nice surprise for you!
0.0 It really was! He had to scrimp and save, but it was worth it for both of us in the end :)	1.0 It is always nice when someone gets their priorities right!
0.0 So.... my dog got hit by a car last night.	1.0 Oh no!  That is horrible!  Is he OK?
0.0 No, unfortunately he didn't make it.	1.0 That is really sad!  I hope it was quick and painless.  I hate seeing anything suffer!
0.0 My son asked to borrow the keys to my car this morning.	1.0 Did you let him borrow it?
0.0 Yeah. I know most people would be worried about doing something like that, but... I trust him not to do anything stupid.	1.0 That's good to hear. I assume everything went ok?
0.0 Yeah, he brought it back in one piece. Which I'm obviously happy about.	1.0 Awesome. Alls well that ends well.
0.0 My daughter asked to borrow my car to go out tonight...	1.0 Did you say yes?
0.0 I haven't given an answer yet. I'm just not sure if it's a wise idea or not.	1.0 Where does she plan to go?
0.0 Boy, it was nice when I wasn't so poor	1.0 Money problems are never fun. Trust me, I know.
0.0 I'm sorry to hear that :( It'd be nice if work paid better	1.0 Yeah, definitely. Have you tried asking for a raise?
0.0 I was sad when I had to put my dog down last month	1.0 Oh no, I'm so so sorry. I've always had at least one pet throughout my life, and they're truly part of the family.
0.0 They are very much family. I cannot believe we get so attached.	1.0 Yes, they're honestly more dear to me than my friends. I hope you're doing okay - I'm sure your dog was very loved and had a wonderful life, so try to take comfort in that.
0.0 I was recently promoted at my job. I didn't expect it to happen, but I got it through hard work so I'm pretty excited about it!	1.0 That is great! Doing what?
0.0 Thank you! I'm now a district manager for a local chain of businesses. It's not my favorite thing to do, but the raise is great!	1.0 I bet that is nice and probably has good benefits!
0.0 I recently went on a long road trip. I wasn't too worried, though, because I packed everything I needed to make it as stress-free as possible. '	1.0 I can never go on long trips.
0.0 Why not? They used to bother me, but I'm finding that as I get older, they're not so bad.	1.0 I can no longer afford them, long trips cost the most.
0.0 I kept laughing at myself for falling down	1.0 Oh no!. Are you ok? Must not have been a bad one if you were laughing?
0.0 Not bad but it was funny because I slipped on a banana peel!	1.0 How ironic. I kind of wish I were there to see it.
0.0 I compete in the Highland games around the country. I just got a new kilt and I look amazing. 	1.0 I am bad at every game.
0.0 It's a little different. It's based in picking up and throwing objects like logs, hammers that weight 70 pounds and stones that weight 70 pounds. Being Scottish it keeps me feeling at home.	1.0 I still could not do that, I am very weak human person.
0.0 I've been very stressed out at work. I had it in my budget so I hired a new office manager. I'm having issues trusting her.	1.0 Do what i did, quit the job and live at home with mom.
0.0 I wish. My mom kicked me out at 14 and I've only seen her a handful of times since over the last 20 years.	1.0 I still thing living with a relative is the cheapest way to go.
0.0 I just pulled up my student loan bill. I've been out of school 10 years and still owe 75k.	1.0 That's awful! Luckily I paid all mine off, but I know many people still struggle with it
0.0 It started off at 150k so I've paid a lot but it's still crazy. Make me think I would have been better off to just go work construction or something instead of college. 	1.0 Yea...the education costs are atrocious and, honestly, not even worth it on my opinion. It's just the piece of paper. The material you learn from them can be learned online for free or nearly so
0.0 My boss is piling on the work but keeping my pay the same. He claims he can't afford to pay me more, but I know that's not true.	1.0 Typical of most companies.  Ask employees to do more and pay less.
0.0 Yep, it's so frustrating. I'm ready to shake up the system but I feel limited in what I can do, besides quit.	1.0 What kind of job do you have?
0.0 I'm so shocked, my pants fell down in public	1.0 I'm sorry, did anyone see?
0.0 I'm hoping not, but it's possible	1.0 I hope you would wear a belt next time.
0.0 My best friend has the best job ever. She is paid to travel the world full time and write Blogs on different locations.	1.0 That sounds like a blast.  Compared to my job LOL.  
0.0 Yes, I know. Ever day I drive an hour to the same place that is slowly killing me inside and she is jetting off to explore.	1.0 I'm sorry.  I like my job but its certainly not like hers!
0.0 Just finished my budget for the week. Woowa, I'm in trouble it's going to be a rice and beans week.	1.0 LOL.  Be careful.. thats a ton of carbs.
0.0 It's better then the alternative. One good meal then water and ketchup soup the rest of the week.	1.0 eww LOL
0.0 I just had my birthday, and my family and fiance did everything they could to make it special. I don't have much, but I'm thankful to have them at least.	1.0 Happy Birthday!
0.0 Thank you! I hope your birthday, whenever it is, is awesome as well!	1.0 What all did they do for you?
0.0 I was proud when my dog learned to sit.	1.0 How long did it take for you to teach you dog that?
0.0 A few days. He was so happy!	1.0 I thought I would take longer, like months!
0.0 This week my work offered to let me work an extra day. I thought great overtime. Nope they plan to send me home every other day to even it out	1.0 Oh no. Maybe you can get some things done around the house.
0.0 Yea like working on my resume and netflix.	1.0 Lol, That sounds like a plan. Working two jobs is hard.
0.0 I'm so happy I ate good food	1.0 Yummy... what did you eat?  I am hungry.
0.0 I had chicken, asparagus, and a portobello mushroom	1.0 That sounds so good.  Like I love that stuff.
0.0 I"m so happy that no one in my family is sick	1.0 I am glad no one in your family is sick.
0.0 Thank you! I hope no one in yours is either	1.0 Thank goodness my family is healthy too.
0.0  went for a job interview. I got the job offer but they offered me less money then I all ready make for more work.	1.0 But do they give raises more frequently and do they have better benefits. It may be worth it still, 
0.0 Not for the first few years. The title would be a move up in status but the pay is about a 20% downgrade. I can't take that loss.	1.0 Benefits are worth a lot more than you think sometimes
0.0 I'm so excited to go out to dinner tomorrow!	1.0 is there a special reason?
0.0 No, we just won't be home so we have to eat out	1.0 going anywhere good?
0.0 Pickle Barrel	1.0 that sounds fun
0.0 I'm been loosing weight January. I'm down 50 pounds. I have 10 more to go but I'm happy.	1.0 That is great. How have you done it?
0.0 I've always walked a lot at work. I average 10 miles a day so kept doing that but I cut out all processed food and drinks. 	1.0 That is a lot of walking. I can hardly walk 1 mile.
0.0 My wife went on a trip for a week to see her family but I had to work so I had to stay home alone.	1.0 I have never been on a trip before.
0.0 I wish I could have went on this one but I couldn't. It ended up bein a long week by myself.	1.0 I have long weeks every single day.
0.0 My current job isn't working out, so I've applied to several others.	1.0 I would just quit and live off the government.
0.0 Haha, I would if I could! Sounds a like much more laidback way to live.	1.0 Everyone can! Just gotta try.
0.0 I found a new stray dog eating out the dumpster last Thursday. Today I officially adopted her.	1.0 how sweet and thoughtful of you
0.0 I already love her. This is the second stray I've found eating out the same dumpster. They are now sisters.	1.0 You seem to be a very compassionate person, very kindhearted.
0.0 About 6 years ago I was diagnosed with cancer.	1.0 Ohh, I so sorry.
0.0 Thank you, it was a very scary situation to be in.	1.0 Hope you are doing better. I'll pray for you.
0.0 I'm doing good now after the chemo and radiation. It is in total remission now.	1.0 Good for you! stay healthy
0.0 I've been trying to eat healthier and work out more, but so far I've only been somewhat successful.	1.0 Forget that! Eat pizza and enjoy life.
0.0 Oh I definitely do both of those things as much as I can. Pizza = perfection	1.0 I agree, I eat what I want when I want all the time.
0.0 I'm so scared to move to a new home	1.0 You have to have fun!
0.0 How can I do that?	1.0 Get drunk and go out!
0.0 Just got home from the grocery store. Forgot my wallet at home. Got to check out and had to apologize to the cashier and leave with out anything. 	1.0 I never go to the store anymore, I wish i did.
0.0 Why not? Dollar store has something for everyone.	1.0 Not for me, i shop online mostly these days.
0.0 I'm about to start a new job, and I'm really nervous about it.	1.0 Just go for it! Never look back!
0.0 Okay, I'll take your advice! Wish me luck!	1.0 Best of luck my friend, you can do anything.
0.0 I get so mad when I watch shows about animal shelters and see how many people abuse animals.	1.0 I own an animal shelter here in my home town.
0.0 It must be so hard to deal with emotionally at times. Just watching a show makes me want to lash out.	1.0 I try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs.
0.0 My daughter killed the GRE!	1.0 That's great! I hope she goes to a good graduate school.
0.0 Thank you! Me too :)	1.0 I am very happy for you!
0.0 "I'm devastated by my mother's death	1.0 I am so sorry to hear that she has passed.  How long has she been gone?
0.0 21 years, but I miss her every single day	1.0 I know how you feel. 
0.0 I have no luck when it comes to lottery tickets, I constantly buy losers.	1.0 I have that same problem!
0.0 A friend of mine bought one right after I did one day, mine was a loser, his was a $15, 000 winner.	1.0 Holy goodness!!! I would be a bit jealous :(
0.0 A friend of mine was in a car accident	1.0 Is your friend ok? What kind of car was it?
0.0 He was driving a compact and a truck hit him.  He didn't make it unfortunately	1.0 That is horrible news, I am so sorry for your loss.
0.0 A co-worker told me we were going to have a lot of work coming up	1.0 Is that good or bad?  Sometimes extra work can be a blessing, unless you are salaried, then it's just more work.
0.0 Bad if anything, I just hope it isn't overwhelming 	1.0 I hope so too.  What kind of work is it?
0.0 my father recently passed suddenly, i was devastated	1.0 Oh, I am sorry for your loss

0.0 Yes, but I really miss him.	1.0 I can understand. I am really sorry
0.0 There was a 2 car accident this morning a driver going the wrong way it had traffic backed up.	1.0 Oh no! Was anyone hurt?

0.0 i didn't ask my husband if i could buy something, now he is mad and i feel bad.	1.0 Aw, I'm sorry, did you just forget or you were thinking about other things?
0.0 I didn't think he would mind.  But it was expensive, so maybe i should have asked.	1.0 Yeah, had a similar scuffle with my wife, but being married sometimes you just have to forgive and forget.
0.0 The bugs that creep me out the most is those eight legged spiders I seen a huge one in my car this weekend.	1.0 I have never liked spiders.
0.0 Me either I screamed so loud lol I be afraid thy may crawl on me I would freak out. 	1.0 You should always have bug spray on you at all times.

0.0 They are still air drying what makes it worse I sat in the sets and it looked like I wet myself lol a little embarrassing. 	1.0 Oh that sounds awful! But at least no one stole anything from your car.
0.0 I found a hair in my pizza, and now I can't eat	1.0 Did you take it back that is so disgusting. 
0.0 I called them and told them about it. They said the next pizza would be free. I said no thanks.	1.0 I wouldn't want another either it takes one time for me to find hair, bug etc and I am done with the restaurant.

0.0 He is my best friend and I think he needs me as much as I need him.	1.0 That is so sweet. My apartments don't allow pets
0.0 I love when I go somewhere and for some reason or another it reminds me of my childhood. It makes me feel so good.	1.0 That is for sure, especially a smell that just throws you back
0.0 OMG yes! Sometimes it's a sound or just a feeling you get for no reason. It's like comfort food .lol	1.0 Exactly, sometimes I just smell a good barbeque and that brings me back to those summer days as a kid, life is great sometimes
0.0 I was suppose to go on vacation with my family last month, but I caught the flu and couldn't go.	1.0 That stinks. Im sorry to hear that
0.0 Yeah, I was looking forward to sitting on the beach and relaxing.	1.0 I bet! It seems like fun
0.0 I am celebrating me and my wife's 5 year anniversary tomorrow and I'm excited about it.	1.0 Congratulations. Fun plans?
0.0 Just going out to dinner and then a romantic night at the beach.	1.0 Awww. I'm jealous lol
0.0 Years ago when we moved into our home, we found a young kitten that had been abandoned.	1.0 Awww. Did you keep it?
0.0 Yes, we did. He was so cute we took him in, and now he is 9 years old.	1.0 Thats great. I know he appreciates it
0.0 I feel very ready for my college exam.	1.0 That's great. I hope you do well!
0.0 Thank you. I think it will be easy!	1.0 Good luck!
0.0 My rabbit died last year, I miss her to this day	1.0 how old was it
0.0 I had her for about 10 years. 	1.0 they live that long ? interesting
0.0 So I asked my boss for a raise today.	1.0 How'd that go?
0.0 It went well, I'm pretty sure that I'll get it!	1.0 Well congratulations! That must have been nerve-wracking.
0.0 So my neighbor just bought a new car. I swear, he always gets really expensive stuff to show off how successful he is.	1.0 That stinks. Maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve
0.0 Maybe... but still. Now I feel like I need to buy one myself.	1.0 Do it! I bet you deserve it
0.0 Last year my wife got into an accident and we only had one car and I was so worried we wouldn't have a car to get to work	1.0 Did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car?
0.0 We didn't have many options but the other persons insurance ended up taking care of it all so we got a rental and the car got fixed but i was so scared .	1.0 Well I am glad it worked out
0.0 Last night I found something in my son's room that made me so mad!	1.0 What did you find?!
0.0 Drugs! I found drugs. I can't believe this.	1.0 Oh no, are you going to talk to him about the dangers of drugs?
0.0 Do you remember that show I was telling you about the other day? It's getting a new season!	1.0 Remind me, which show was that?
0.0 The one with the three cops that can never agree with each other but end up solving the cases anyway. I'm so happy about this news!	1.0 That's so cool!  I'm gonna have to check it out
0.0 I was going through some boxes today, and I found a really old picture of me with my grandmother.	1.0 That's nice. Are you going to hang it up?
0.0 Yeah, definitely. It brings back really good memories.	1.0 Great, you've found an old treasure.
0.0 My girlfriend broke up with me recently...	1.0 I'm sorry. How long had you been together?
0.0 We were together for 3 years. I can't stand being alone.	1.0 Just try and get through each day, one at a time. Don't think too far ahead.
0.0 I keep hearing noises coming from my basement...	1.0 That sounds scary.  Are you going to investigate?
0.0 I want to, but I'm a bit scared. Maybe I should take something with me to defend myself, just in case.	1.0 If this were a movie, I'd be yelling at the screen for you to leave the house and not go down there.
0.0 I can't believe this! My son failed a really important test.	1.0 I am so sorry to hear that.  Is he planning to retake the test?
0.0 I sure hope so. Otherwise he might not be able to graduate.	1.0 What test?
0.0 They other day was my son's first day of school, and when I dropped him off it brought back so much memories.	1.0 That's great. Is that your only son?
0.0 Yes, he's my only son. I cant wait until he get's his first girlfriend like I did in middle school. Those were the days.	1.0 I'm sure the memories will be great
0.0 So I've been walking around all day with a huge hole in the back of my pants... I just found out about it.	1.0 Oh wow! Hopefully no one saw it
0.0 If they did, no one told me about it! So embarrassing.	1.0 Im sorry about that. Ive gone through that before. Laughter can be good medicine sometimes
0.0 So that new game that I've been looking forward to is coming out in a few weeks!	1.0 What is it called ?
0.0 Oh, I'm sure it's not one that you've heard of. I'm pretty excited though, I've been saving up money for it for a few months now.	1.0 Okay, well I guess I'm happy for you then.
0.0 Yesterday, I caught my neighbor letting his dog poop on my lawn. I had a few choice words for him.	1.0 That's understandable.  How receptive was he to your complaint?
0.0 He wasn't to happy about me confronting him. I told him if it happens again it might get physical.	1.0 Oh, so it got pretty serious.  I guess he needs to learn to respect boundaries.
0.0 I was going through some boxes in my attic today.	1.0 Did you find anything?
0.0 Yeah, I found some old toys from my childhood. So many memories came flooding back into my mind.	1.0 I bet that was very nostalgic for you.
0.0 I can't believe that my coworker got the promotion that I was going for. This is ridiculous.	1.0 That's a hard hit to take.  Why do you suspect they got it?
0.0 I honestly have no idea. I was definitely more deserving of that position.	1.0 So what are you going to do about?  Are you going to start looking for another place to work?
0.0 I'm so ashamed of myself. I made a big mistake on a project for work.	1.0 What did you mess up?
0.0 It was something for an important client. Now I'm afraid this is going to screw up my career.	1.0 I'm sure you'll be fine.  Have you made many similar mistakes in the past?
0.0 No, this is the first time I've messed up anything like this.	1.0 I wouldn't worry too much about it then.  Don't let it get you down.
0.0 I bought a used car a few years ago and found 500 dollars tucked in the back seat!	1.0 Wow, that's nice. I hope you treated yourself to something extravagant!
0.0 Oh I spent it on a few things. I was just surprised someone didn't find it when it was being cleaned.	1.0 I guess they didn't do as good a job as they should have, lol. Wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks!
0.0 I know! made it not so bad that the car I traded in was a junker and not worth much lol	1.0 Well, it was worth $500! That's about what my car's worth these days - had it for years. Still runs great tho'.
0.0 I'm going camping with my kids this weekend.	1.0 How fun! In a tent or an RV?
0.0 In a tent. I just have to make extra sure that I pack all of the supplies that we'll need.	1.0 Don't forget a first aid kit! We always need those on camping trips!
0.0 On my way home today there was someone in the fast lane going so slow in front of me.	1.0 Ugh, that's so annoying.  How long did you have to follow behind them?
0.0 about 5 miles. there was too much trafic in the slow lane, couldn't get over	1.0 I hope you weren't late for anything important!
0.0 I was watching television earlier today when I came across a channel that was showing a bunch of cartoons that I loved when I was younger.	1.0 memory lane right there! which cartoons? 
0.0 It was a whole bunch of different ones from the 90's. Man, they really reminded me of my childhood.	1.0 Very cool I havent seen the older style cartoons myself in years.
0.0 I keep getting strange phone calls. It's creeping me out.	1.0 That would creep me out too what kind of calls?? 
0.0 The person on the other end just keeps making really weird sounds until I hang up. I'm not sure what I should do about it.	1.0 Alright that would creep me out too. Block the number or change yours!! weird. 
0.0 My boyfriend told me he quit drinking, but I just found a bunch of empty liquor bottles he hid in his room.	1.0 Uh oh. Are you going to confront him about it?
0.0 Absolutely, but it probably won't go well. He needs help but he won't accept it.	1.0 Well I hope that he actually listens to you this time and gets help.
0.0 Yay! I'm finally getting a promotion at work!	1.0 Congratulations, that's awesome! I hope you're getting a raise too!
0.0 Yeah, a raise will definitely come with it. I've put a lot of work into this, and it finally paid off!	1.0 Hope you treat yourself to celebrate, you deserve it!
0.0 So I might be up for a promotion soon at work!	1.0 That sounds amazing! When will you find out? 
0.0 Soon. There are several other people trying to get the same position, but I'm pretty hopeful that things will work out in my favor.	1.0 You sound positive so I am sure you will get it!!! 
0.0 We went to get gas one night and my husband and an altercation with some guy, guy pulledoutabig knife in the storeand by our car at the gas station.	1.0 omg, that's so scary! are you okay? did you call the police?
0.0 yes we called the police he was arrested! 	1.0 that's good to hear! people are crazy
0.0 i envy my friend who is off work today	1.0 I bet.  It is nice to have a day off every now and then
0.0 it definitely is	1.0 I like having days off to do absolutly nothing.  It helps with stress.
0.0 Ugh, my cat keeps climbing up the curtains in my room.	1.0 That's the worst.  Is it damaging the curtains too much?
0.0 Yeah, he's tearing them up. I really wish he'd stop.	1.0 Is there anything you can put on them or near them to stop him?
0.0 We've decided to adopt another cat from the shelter!	1.0 That is great! Adopt, don't shop! Always a great motto!
0.0 Agreed, that's my motto! This is a high-kill shelter too, so we'll definitely be saving a life :)	1.0 That is great, I commend you!
0.0 i am nervous for a meeting i have later	1.0 Have you prepared enough for it?
0.0 yeah i believe so	1.0 Well Im sure you be fine. Just relax.
0.0 im happy with my health for the first time in a few years	1.0 That's good to hear! Have you been eating healthy?
0.0 yes definitely, and getting plenty of exercise 	1.0 That's great! Keep up the good work!
0.0 I bought some new food for my dog, and he refuses to eat it.	1.0 thats strange, my dog will eat anything lol
0.0 Yeah, that's what I thought about mine too. I bought a huge bag of the stuff, too. It's so irritating.	1.0 maybe he will start warming up to it soon
0.0 My coworker gave a really nice presentation at work today.	1.0 About what?!
0.0 Oh it was just boring work stuff, about a client. But I was really awed by the amount of work that she put into it.	1.0 That's awesome. I'm glad she did well.
0.0 I've been working hard and doing a great job for several months, but still no raise.	1.0 thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return 
0.0 Yeah, especially when my boss promised to pay me more. Might be time to quit!	1.0 Oh I just quit a few weeks ago due to a similar situation actually! Never been happier! 
0.0 im nervous about taking a test soon	1.0 Did you study for it or are you winging it?
0.0 i feel pretty prepared	1.0 Don't worry then.  You did you part!! I'm sure you will do fine!
0.0 My roommate is gone for the week, on a business trip. It's way too quiet around here.	1.0 Maybe you should try and have a party?
0.0 That's a good idea. I can't stand being alone in this place much longer.	1.0 Yes being alone is not very fun.
0.0 My birthday is coming up next week. I'm really looking forward to it.	1.0 What will your new age be?
0.0 I'll be turning 35. And some friends are coming that I haven't seen in years, it'll be great to see them again.	1.0 You should have a great time, congrats on the new age!
0.0 My wife and I got a divorce. The house is so quiet without her and the kids being here.	1.0 I went through a similar thing a few years back.  Everything seemed hollow to me.  How long has it been?
0.0 About two years now and everything still seems very odd to me.	1.0 If your depressed, speak to someone.  If it's just adjusting to the change, that comes in time.
0.0 Uh oh. I'm in trouble now.	1.0 Why is it that you are in trouble?
0.0 I lost a really important document at work... telling my boss is going to be so embarrassing.	1.0 Can you just replace the document?
0.0 There's a creepy guy that comes by at work that won't stop bothering me. He writes crazy letters, and keeps calling on the phone "just to chat" with me.	1.0 I would be reporting that to the police for sure. 
0.0 I tried. They said they can't do anything unless he actually tries to physically harm me, which is insane to me.	1.0 Thats true right.. i forgot how stupid the law can be sometimes. Thats insane. 
0.0 My father was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer.	1.0 Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. That must be very difficult for you and your family.
0.0 Yes it was. It only took a few short months and my father passed away due to it being inoperable.	1.0 I am so sorry for your loss. I hope that you find peace in this difficult time.
0.0 I'm starting a new job next week! Can't wait to be doing something different for a change!	1.0 That's great. What will you be doing at your new job?
0.0 Thanks! Graphic design mostly. At my old job I was a manager and it was horrible.	1.0 Sometimes being a manager is the worst job you can have at a place, you seem to be the one who gets blamed for everything.
0.0 Recently, I got passed over for a promotion at my job.	1.0 Aw man, that sucks. Promotions usually aren't given fairly in my experience. Was that the case for you too?
0.0 No, the guy that got it was qualified, it's just I really wanted the job. It would have really help my career.	1.0 I'll keep my fingers crossed for you that you get that promotion next time!
0.0 I bought a scratch off lottery ticket the other day, and won $5000.	1.0 That is amazingly lucky! good for you!
0.0 I almost passed out, I have never won so much money before.	1.0 That is great! I wish I was lucky like that!
0.0 Had to take my cat to the vet. He's got a bad injury on his paw and it hasn't been healing.	1.0 Awh poor baby.. I am sure itll get better now tho! How old is he? 
0.0 He's 8 years old. They're going to have to put him down - turns out he has feline aids :(	1.0 Ugh noooo! Thats terrible i am so sorry. :( 
0.0 One of my art pieces has been chosen to be put in a exhibition!	1.0 I would be so excited! Did they pay you for it? 
0.0 Haven't been paid for it yet, but people that visit are welcome to put in an offer for anything they see! Fingers crossed someone wants mine!	1.0 Hopefully! that would be so amazing! 
0.0 I was enjoying the morning watching the kids play in the pool.	1.0 That sounds like such a fun, peaceful morning. So jealous you have a pool, it's been scorching outside!
0.0 Well it's only a kiddie pool, kids are very little. It was a very nice morning.	1.0 Ah okay, nice for the kiddos then. They grow up fast, so hold onto these moments while you can:)
0.0 As a child, I was mean to my sister all the time and I still feel awful about it.	1.0 Aw, well when your younger you don't do those things on purpose. I think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then.
0.0 True, but she's very sensitive. I'm sure it still bothers her. I try to make up for it today, but I never can take those things back.	1.0 Have you talked to her about it? Maybe she doesn't really think about it anymore.
0.0 my husband and i lostour daughter 2years ago and i don't care to celebrate mother's day and he still impressed me with a gift	1.0 I am so sorry to hear about your loss. What did he get you?
0.0 he got my favorite flower, an orchid a card and made dinner 	1.0 That was very nice of him. I'm glad you have a nice husband.
0.0 Went to get an oil change the other day. Turns out I didn't need one for another 1, 000 miles, and I felt like such a fool.	1.0 Well better to be sooner than later on something like that. Dont be hard on yourself. 
0.0 Agreed, and it had been 5 months so I figured I was due. The mechanic was really condescending which was what made it embarrassing!	1.0 Thats so silly its none of his worry. He needs to hush up. lol 
0.0 My cat somehow managed to lock himself in the bathroom last night. I still can't figure out how he did it.	1.0 Wow! He sounds like a super smart cat! How did you get him out of there?
0.0 He is! Well, both smart and dumb haha. Had to use a knitting needle to pick the lock!	1.0 Well at least you managed to save him!
0.0 I've got a coworker with zero social skills, and it's driving me batty. She can't seem to tell no one wants to listen to her talk for 30 minutes straight.	1.0 Oh man, I've definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before. What does she even talk about?
0.0 If you make a comment on anything, say cats, she'll go into a monologue about everything she's ever learned about a cat (most of it wrong).	1.0 That's the worst! Some people, once they get started, they just can't stop themselves. It's like opening a can of Pringles.
0.0 We had an annoying client the other day, and I went to the breakroom to complain about her to my coworkers (thinking she couldn't hear).	1.0 Did it feel good to get it out?
0.0 It did at first, until I left the room and saw she was sitting right by the door where she could hear everything! It was humiliating and I felt really bad for her after that.	1.0 Oh no, that's awkward! Did you get in trouble for it?
0.0 I found some baby kittens in my yard, their mother was dead. I nursed them to health and found homes for them.	1.0 That's heartbreaking, but you're amazing for doing that. Cats are my favorite and I've rescued many animals. It's a lot of work.
0.0 They are my favorite, too. I love how independent they are.	1.0 Yes, and when they love you it feels special, because they don't love everyone like dogs do. You've racked up a lot of good karma for saving them!
0.0 Finances aren't great right now. I've got a lot of bills that are overdue, but I can't afford to pay them :(	1.0 I'm there too. Struggling each day. It really gets old.
0.0 I'm sorry we're both in this situation. It really sucks, and it feels unfair because it's not for lack of effort.	1.0 Yeah, that's right. I've been pushing 70 hours working a week for as long as I can remember. Hold out, maybe it'll change.
0.0 I was out of school for over a year and thought i forgot everything before taking this big test	1.0 You would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break!
0.0 I know it was nerve wrecking but studying all the time and i mean al the time paid off 	1.0 Im glad it paid off for you, you must be super proud!
0.0 A few years back I got laid off from my job because they were losing too much money. It broke me, I really loved that job.	1.0 Oh no, I am so sorry. What did you do?
0.0 To be honest, I fell into a pretty deep depression. No one wanted to hire me. It was tough.	1.0 That is tough. That must have been quite the trying time. Did you eventually find work?
0.0 im stoked to go see some old friends tomorrow night	1.0 Good, how long has it been since you saw them last?
0.0 about a year and a half!	1.0 I hope you all have some fun.
0.0 I'm SO ready for fall - it's been incredibly hot all summer, and I need my favorite season to hurry up & get here!	1.0 Oh yes, fall is definitely my favorite season as well! I love fall scents!
0.0 Me too! Wearing comfy sweaters, snuggling up with a hot drink, and fall smell on the air...can't wait for it!	1.0 It is the best season, by far! Plus, Halloween!
0.0 A bunch of fruit flies appeared in my apartment out of nowhere the other day. I think it's because of some old veggies in my fridge. Totally gross.	1.0 Oh man, those things are awful and reproduce like crazy.  We left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere! The best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar, a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it.  They will gravitate toward it and you'll catch a bunch! Just keep changing it every few days.
0.0 Thanks for the tip, I will try that! I cleaned out the fridge and most of them seemed to just go away. I have no idea where they go but don't really care either as long as they're gone!	1.0 Seriously, gone is good.  They do have bacteria on them and lay their eggs on fruit and veggies and the larva burrow into the fruit or veggie so its good you trashed it all. Glad you're free of them!
0.0 I'm getting married next year! Hoping everything goes smoothly and we get the wedding we want to have.	1.0 That is so exciting! It can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding.
0.0 Boy are you right about that. I was really excited during the early planning stages, but it's been stressful ever since.	1.0 It really gets stressful when you get down to the last minute. You are always so worried you are going to forget something.
0.0 My friends went ahead and gave me a baby shower that I didn't know about.	1.0 oh that was nice of them
0.0 Yeah, they had told my husband about it so he could get me there.	1.0 haha thats pretty fun
0.0 I have an adorable hamster that doesn't look like he's doing well. He is on the old side for hamsters, and I'm worried he won't live much longer.	1.0 Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. I hope that he gets to feeling better. How old is he?
0.0 Thank you, me too! He's a little over 2 years old. I'd hate to lose him, but they usually don't live more than 2-3 years.	1.0 Oh I see, I can understand your concern. Perhaps he will live longer than most hamsters!
0.0 I went back to work for my former company recently. They laid me off a few years ago when things were tough. Coming back was a little scary but I was thrilled!	1.0 That is awesome!  I would be really excited if I were in yyour shoes!
0.0 Yes, that's exactly how I felt. I suspected they'd been in trouble for a while so when they asked me to come back and help them out it felt really good.	1.0 I hope you go far in your job!  Good luck!
0.0 im upset that my neighbor's dog is sick	1.0 That is quite upsetting. Do you know what ails it?
0.0 no they are at the vet now	1.0 Well I certainly hope that the dog gets to feeling better. Are you close friends with this canine companion?
0.0 Well i had spent the good part of a week organising the best weekend away with my hubby for our 10th wedding anniversary. Spa day, great dinner, concert and of course the parents were booked to mind the kids for the weekend.  However all did not go to plan...	1.0 Oh no, what happened? Hopefully the whole weekend didn't get ruined!
0.0 Well unfortunately the day before we were due to go my little 2 year old daughter woke up covered in spots.  As the day went on more and more appeared and she had a roaring temperature.  We realised she had chickenpox.  She was feeling so miserable and of course all she wanted was her mummy and daddy.  It was a bit depressing and part of me was devastated but our weekend away was not to be.  Sure kids always come first dont they?!	1.0 Poor little thing, chicken pox are the worst. On the bright side, you still got to spend your anniversary with your husband, just not, you know, in the way you hoped. Hope you guys get to have a make-up weekend soon!
0.0 My neighbor has a brand new Tesla and every time I look at it I get so envious. I know it's stupid, I should be happy for him that he has such a cool car.	1.0 Wow thats nice.  What do you drive?
0.0 Well that's the thing, I don't. I bike everywhere. Don't get me wrong, I love my bike and it's a great way to stay fit. 	1.0 You have to think of the positives.  Just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great.  They could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are.
0.0 That is a really good way to put it, I will definitely keep that in mind next time I find myself pining after his car.	1.0 lol and some day you might you buy your own new Tesla, if you feel like it!
0.0 A Tesla with a bike rack!	1.0 Exactly!
0.0 I'm happy my package just arrived	1.0 oh thats nice
0.0 im glad it came earlier	1.0 yea i would be to
0.0 I'm feeling nostalgic today	1.0 Why's that?
0.0 I found some old keepsakes in the basement ealier	1.0 Nostalgia is a weird feeling.
0.0 I've got a fun weekend coming up, and I'm really looking forward to it!	1.0 Nice, what do you have planned?
0.0 Going to the drive-in, out to eat, and probably minigolf. Nothing particularly special, just haven't had fun in awhile!	1.0 Sound great, I'm happy for you!
0.0 I recently had a project of mine recognized in a national publication!	1.0 Wow!  That must feel great!  You should be proud of this accomplishment.  People can go their whole lives without ever being published!
0.0 It felt amazing to be recognized for my work, and in a publication I respect to boot! 	1.0 Congratulations!  I wish I could be published.
0.0 I am going to Disney next year. I want to write a list of everything to bring.	1.0 What are some things you will bring?
0.0 I'm not really sure. I think if I write things out that I could possibly need I won't forget anything.	1.0 It's a good idea to write thing down that you might forget.
0.0 Things have been rough for me lately, but thankfully I've got family and a fiance that are helping me through it.	1.0 What is wrong? Are you okay?
0.0 I'm in a lot of debt thanks to my car needing expensive repairs, and haven't been able to afford it. It's pretty depressing not being able to pay your bills :/	1.0 I am so sorry. I hope you get all the help you need.
0.0 the rain today is frustrating	1.0 We have been getting a lot of rain as well. I have to mow my lawn so much.
0.0 im not a fan of it at all	1.0 Yeah I know what you mean. I can't wait for the rainy season to end.
0.0 The other day I was riding my bike and this woman ran a stop sign, nearly hitting me. Thank goodness I was paying attention and was able to stop in time.	1.0 Oh my goodness, I've almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it's terrifying. I'm so glad you're alright!
0.0 I wish people would pay more attention. I try to do my best to follow the rules of the road both when I'm on my bike and in a car.	1.0 Ditto. It's not hard to do, and so many lives would be saved if people would just follow the rules. I'll send good vibes out so nothing bad happens to you in the future!
0.0 My boyfriend proposed to me, and I accepted! I thought he didn't want to get married so it was a welcome surprise.	1.0 Wow, congratulations! Have you guys set a date yet?
0.0 Thank you! We're hoping to get married sometime next year, but man weddings are expensive. It may be further off than I'd like!	1.0 Oh I feel you, I used to work in the wedding industry. It's crazy how much it costs even for the most basic wedding.
0.0 I just had my birthday and I ate WAY too much. Had a good time, but boy do I feel bad for all of that food. I'm supposed to be eating healthier!	1.0 I know exactly how that happens. Sometimes the food is just too good to pass up.
0.0 No kidding. Had free refills on a root beer float too, and how could I say no to that?	1.0 Well I say go for it. It is only your birthday once a year. The other 364 days can make up for it.
0.0 i am pleased with the day im having today	1.0 Glad to hear you are having a good day. Wish every day was like that.
0.0 me too but we wouldnt appreciate the good days if it werent for the bad	1.0 That is true. It puts things in context.
0.0 Every night before bed, we read the Bible to our son. I love when he relates what he learned to real life.	1.0 That is really awesome! That is so important to be involved in his life like that. 
0.0 It is. And shows that he is listening. 	1.0 It does! Kids can understand things about the bible that most adults overlook. 
0.0 Our mail carrier keeps leaving packages outside instead of putting them in the lobby.	1.0 that is frustrating, especially if the weather isnt ideal 
0.0 Exactly! It rained the other day and my package was totally ruined.	1.0 that is unfortunate, im sorry that happened!
0.0 My friend left my front door open when she was house-sitting for me. My cat snuck out and was killed.	1.0 That isn't good. Are you mad at your friend?
0.0 I was really upset at the time but once I had some time I realized it was an honest mistake. She felt really bad about it.	1.0 Are you going to get another cat?
0.0 I can't wait for it to be Christmas already. Just thinking about that time of year makes me really happy.	1.0 I feel the same way as well!  I get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts!
0.0 Exactly! And the food, and friends. All of it is just so lovely.	1.0 I agree!  Everything that surrounds Christmas makes me smile and feel content.  It makes me thankful for everything good in life!
0.0 Each day waking up I can't believe how lucky am I just to be alive.	1.0 That's a great outlook I think. We often lose focus of that very important fact.
0.0 Yes, I don't need anything. I have something to eat and a roof over my head. I really can't ask for anything more.	1.0 That's inspiring to me. I will try to think more like that as well whenever I get stressed in life.
0.0 I went running for the first time in months. I could not believe it. I was able to run a full 8 miles with out taking a break.	1.0 8 Miles!? That's very impressive.  I bet I could barely make it a mile!
0.0 Yes, my first time out in 60 days. I impressed my self.	1.0 Have you been a long time runner before that?
0.0 Just gave my wife access to my credit card. I'm worried but excited I can trust her. Do you ever have issues trusting people?	1.0 I can relate to that!  Yeah, my wife with my credit card, lol!
0.0 It's taken me 11 years to get to this point. Last time I let her have at it. She bought us a trip to mexico on my credit card.	1.0 Haha, I can understand the hesitation then.  But was the vacation at least worth the money?
0.0 "I've been at my current job 5 years. I'm at the point I can go into upper management but I'm afraid. Maybe I'm just comfortable now. I don't know. 	1.0 That's something that takes a lot of contemplation, because it's such a big decision to make. Will the extra money be worth the extra work?
0.0 An extra 40k a year but it would be highly stressful. Currently I have the highest ratings in the USA, I'm sure any new employer would want me to bring them up to that stage as well. 	1.0 Oh wow, an additional 40K is a lot! I'd be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large.
0.0 I currently work 50 hours a week. I'd be working around 75-80 a week then.	1.0 Oh wow. I'll be honest and say it wouldn't be worth it for me! What's an extra 40K if you're never not at work to enjoy it?
0.0 I took my wife surfing for the first time today. within an hour she was riding waves, Color me impressed!	1.0 Oh wow, I think it'd take me much longer to not bust my butt! That is impressive!
0.0 Yes, I was surprised. I've been at it my entire life and never seen anyone pick it up so quickly. She is not even athletic.	1.0 Maybe she's more athletic than you think! She might be better than you soon. Better watch out!
0.0 A friend of mine bought a new car	1.0 awesome! what kind?
0.0 Tesla, I've had my eye on the model for some time	1.0 oh man those are super nice! all electric is pretty neat
0.0 A friend of mine got a new high paying job	1.0 That's good on his part, how do you feel about it?
0.0 I thought it was amazing he got it, seemed like a tough job to land	1.0 That's awesome, and I agree, the job market is tough now a days.  High paying or not.
0.0 A co-worker of mine was late delivering materials for a project	1.0 Oh that's no good. Any special reason why they were late?
0.0 The guy just doesn't seem to care	1.0 That's a bad attitude to have. I hope he can straighten up a bit if we wants to keep working there.
0.0 Going to the doctor for the first time since 2001 tomorrow. I'm dreading telling the doctor how long it has been since my last visit. 	1.0 It will be okay. It's always hard making that step, but it's good for your health to do it.
0.0 I'm only going because my insurance gives me a gift card for going. I'm in perfect health. But still ashamed.	1.0 I wish my insurance would give me something like that! It's good to go anyways.
0.0 im scared of this big test tomorrow	1.0 Have you studied for it?  Always helps to prepare!
0.0 yes i have, still nervous though	1.0 Good luck, I'm sure you will do fine!
0.0 My wife and I are on a diet together for the last month. We have been doing great but today on my way home from work I stopped for Ice cream and did not tell her.	1.0 Hey everyone trips up a little. What you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that. 
0.0 Yea I know. The real issues is that I want to stop again from more tomorrow. 	1.0 It's ok to have a cheat day everyone once in a while, but you can't give in. Be strong!
0.0 I just turned in my dissertation. I'm scared it will not pass and all my work toward my masters will be for nothing.	1.0 You only get to do it once?
0.0 Yes, you turn it in then go in front of a board of people. In my case 10 people. If they don't like it I can't go one to work on my PhD and will need to write another. This one has taken 2 years to write.	1.0 Oh no. I hope it goes well for you. That's a lot of hard work.
0.0 I finally got a raise at my job	1.0 Congrats!
0.0 I was pretty happy, it was long overdue	1.0 Was it more than expected?
0.0 The other day I was drinking and sent an email I shouldn't have. I felt so stupid when I woke up and realized what I'd done.	1.0 That has happened to me, but with texts though lol
0.0 Yeah I've done that, too. The funny thing is I'm usually pretty eloquent even when I'm drunk so I don't think the recipient even realized I was drunk when I wrote it.	1.0 Did you apologize?
0.0 No, when they responded I just played it off like I meant to send it. Everything turned out fine!	1.0 LOL
0.0 My car has been having issues lately	1.0 what's wrong with it?
0.0 Engine issues I think, not sure if the car will make it	1.0 can you fix it?
0.0 Got on the scale today. I've only been on a diet 2 weeks and I'm down 17 pounds.	1.0 That is great news. Have you also been working out?
0.0 Not really. I average 10 miles a day walking at work but did that when I was fat as well. I cut out all processed foods and drinks.	1.0 Has it been easy or hard to do that?
0.0 I took some candy a friend left out	1.0 did they notice it was missing?
0.0 Not yet, I plan on compensating my friend for what I took	1.0 well at least you are attempting to be honest about it.
0.0 I just realized today I have not been home to where my family is from in a little over 10 years.	1.0 Ohh wow! Are you excited?
0.0 No I'm not going. I don't have time and my family dose not talk to me. I just miss home.	1.0 Ohh that stinks. I dont blame you though
0.0 The other day this creepy guy followed me around the store and chased me out to the parking lot. He just wouldn't take a hint.	1.0 That's very creepy, did he say anything to you?
0.0 Yeah that's what made it weird, it was kind of like he was trying to hit on me but just awkward. But he was really pushy about it.	1.0 Those are definitely the scary types, they don't recognize social cues at all.
0.0 A close friend said she was having problems with her knee	1.0 Ouch!  Did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing? I hope she can find help with physical therapy.
0.0 Hopefully she will see a doctor soon about it	1.0 Oh good.  Hopefully she'll try to fix it with physical therapy first.  Some doctors love to do surgery right away when its not necessary.  Recommend that she get a second opinion.  Hope she resolves it!
0.0 A co-worker stole my lunch	1.0 I've never understood that, it's not like they can't afford to eat since they have a job! Do you know which coworker it was?
0.0 Not entirely sure, I marked my lunch so they knew it wasn't theirs	1.0 Next time bring your lunch in a biohazard bag, maybe they will leave it alone.
0.0 A friend of mine revealed a deep dark secret I told her in confidence to everyone. 	1.0 What did you do?
0.0 I blocked her and sent her a long text explaining how angry and disappointed I was. I didn't know what else to do.	1.0 You definitely can't be too careful these days
0.0 Every single time I go in the office bathroom someone comes in and needs something. If I don't go to the bathroom no one comes in all day.	1.0 how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there?
0.0 Because I work in the same little office alone all day. Today I did not use the bathroom no one came in. yesterday I went twice and each time I went I had someone waiting on me when I got back to my desk.	1.0 ok
0.0 I discovered my cat peed on my bath mat when I got out of the shower today and the mat was wet.	1.0 Oh no! That stinks. I've never had a cat specifically because I've never been good with the idea of being able to train them. Plus it seems like you just get the one personality, and they never grow to like you. But I'm biased.
0.0 It's funny you say that, I actually like that about cats. They are independent and not too needy, which sort of describes me! I love my cats... the peeing on my bath mat aside.	1.0 Yeah, I know they definitely suit some people. I actually now technically have one... my roommate wanted to get one, and I felt too bad to say no. And he actually is a pretty nice guy, mostly because he's been affectionate from the start. So, we'll see how it goes! Sorry again about your mat.
0.0 I got the courage to contact a potential client the other day and set a rate for my work that's higher than I usually charge.	1.0 Wow good for you! I hope that it works out for you!
0.0 Thanks! The work isn't terribly exciting but it felt good not having to negotiate knowing the client wanted me to do work for them.	1.0 Yeah and I bet the higher paycheck will make the work worth it. 
0.0 Someone hit my car and fled the scene	1.0 What! First of all, are you alright?
0.0 Yeah, I'm fine, the car was parked	1.0 Oh, well that's something, at least. I can't believe people are such cowards, though.
0.0 'm promoting two staff members on Sunday. They work hard and are great people.	1.0 That's great. Do they know?
0.0 They have no clue. They know I ask them to do more then others but are clueless. I'm excited for them and the also the stress load they will take off of me. 	1.0 Well that is awesome. I bet they won't let you down in the new positions either
0.0 'm running my first Marathon Sunday. I'm scared that maybe I did not train hard enough.	1.0 I have never run a marathon
0.0 No better time to try then now.	1.0 You can try your best and if you don't finish there is always the next one
0.0 I will not run If I can't finish. I'm stubborn I'll finish or kill over.	1.0 Well that's some sort of motivation lol
0.0 Just finished my Master's degree now time to take on a PhD	1.0 Congratulations!  What are you getting your PhD in?
0.0 Astrophysics	1.0 Oh geeze, I didn't know I was talking to a genius.  How long is the program?
0.0 I start my last year of my Masters program Friday. I'm scared I feel like I'm all ready behind.	1.0 Have you tried to talk to your teacher?
0.0 No it's mostly I feel behind on my thesis. When I started they told us keep up or drop out. I should have known, it's one of the hardest schools to get into.	1.0 What school is this you are talking about?
0.0 I spent all summer getting ready to write my thesis. I can't wait to get time to start.	1.0 That's pretty cool that you're motivated and excited to start it. Most people would be scared and procrastinating. You'll do great.
0.0 I need to get it over. I need to start paying back student loans. It's the last thing I need to do before I can get hired as a Ad Professor. 	1.0 Sounds like you have a plan laid out. It also sounds like you've already accomplished so much.. You should be very proud. I'm with you, I have over $40, 000 in student loans. Such a crazy pressure on someone right when they graduate. Good luck!
0.0 I love to be snuggled up with attention and time with my boyfriend when he doesn't I get sad and jealous. 	1.0 I can understand that.
0.0 I know he has to spend time with others but I get envious I want every minute spent together I'm spoiled lol.	1.0 You must love him very much, that's good.
0.0 I'm at a new school and I won't have any friends	1.0 Aw, it takes time! Making friends isn't always so easy so give it a little bit of time
0.0 Yes, but how do I even talk to people I don't know?	1.0 The best thing to do is join clubs and get involved. You generally make friends by association!
0.0 I felt very great a few weeks ago when i helped an elderly women bag her groceries	1.0 that is really nice of you to do, not a lot of people help others like that anymore
0.0 Yeah thats true most people don't.  I love helping those in need it's a great feeling	1.0 same with me if i ever see someone that could use my help, i will most likely bring it to you
0.0 I can't believe I didn't get that promotion at work :(	1.0 Ah dang... Sorry that happened to you. It stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more, or who has better connections, and not actual merit. If you're good, I'm sure you will get recognized at some point.
0.0 Agreed, it's a popularity contest!	1.0 Well, keep a good attitude. If you like the work and the job, hopefully that will be enough.
0.0 My wife cheated on me! It's absurd!!	1.0 Thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you 
0.0 Thank you, what should I do about it?	1.0 I would suggest moving on time heals all wounds
0.0 I was very happy last week helping an elderly women bag her groceries 	1.0 Did she say thank you?
0.0 Yes she did thank me 	1.0 What a lovely woman, and you're lovely, too!
0.0 Ugh, my neighbor's dogs wouldn't stop barking this morning!	1.0 That's the worst! What did you do?
0.0 Well I'll tell you what I didn't do. I didn't go back to sleep, due to the noise. I think I'm going to have a word with him later.	1.0 That sounds like a good idea. I hope you solve the problem quickly!
0.0 Remember when we were young and could run through the fields of flowers? I miss it.	1.0 Yeah, those were better times. Brings back good memories.
0.0 Maybe we can relive such times through our children.	1.0 Well, maybe yours. Mine just want to sit inside and play on their phones all day.
0.0 I don't understand why people come to work to just not do their jobs I have a coworker like this.	1.0 Oh man..I have had those too..and where I am the one getting crap even though I do my job and everyone elses..I HATE sitting around at work...I either want to work or go home. I hope your boss knows your co-worker is lazy?
0.0 We are on the same page I have to pick up their slack and it just irritates me to the upmost it's like just quit please or give me a raise for doing double work. 	1.0 I AGREE and frankly if your boss does not see this and doesn't give you praise then I would quit as well or contact human resources! This kind of stuff is not acceptable.
0.0 The desert was incredible! The taste! The look! The feel as I ate it!	1.0 sounds like you ate a delicious dessert, what did you eat?
0.0 It was chocolate ice cream dipped in crushed cookies, marshmallows, and chocolate sauce which had frozen to a crisp!	1.0 that sounds delicious i love chocolate cake i think that would be my favorite dessert
0.0 I think I'm going to move my mother into my house with us.	1.0 O? That's a brave and noble decision.
0.0 Yeah, she's been pretty sick lately. I want to make sure she's here where she can get all of the care that she needs.	1.0 That's hard but great of you to do, good luck.
0.0 I'm going shopping tomorrow, it'll be so much fun!	1.0 Where will you be shopping?
0.0 I think I'll go to Costco and Walmart.	1.0 Nice! Do you have anything in specific you want to buy?
0.0 I'm so sad, my avocado was moldy this morning!	1.0 hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing
0.0 It really is! :(	1.0 did you still eat it? or did you throw it away
0.0 My family is the best they through me a surprise birthday party.	1.0 That's nice of them! People stopped doing that for me once I got older. I miss them
0.0 I was amazed they even did that but very grateful I haven't had anything in a while also so you wasn't alone your family will do something and you will enjoy it. 	1.0 Well, I'm happy for you :) It shows that they care
0.0 i was shocked when i found out my wife cheated on me	1.0 Thats horrible! Im so sorry to hear that.  Why would she do that?
0.0 Im not sure what should i do though ?	1.0 It depends, if you love her, you could try to work it out.  Or you could cheat on her too
0.0 My friend taught his dog some tricks. It's really fun to watch!	1.0 O yea? I
0.0 It's amazing how quickly the dog responds to the commands. My friend must really know what he's doing.	1.0 I'm trying to teach mine tricks myself* I think that's fun to watch!
0.0 I was taking an important test in one of my classes the other day... I'm ashamed to say that I cheated.	1.0 I've cheated on occasion. It's never right but it's easy. At least you're ashamed of it.
0.0 Yeah... I'm thinking about coming clean about it to my professor before he finds out on his own.	1.0 That's your decision to make, but I think it would at least put you in control of the situation.
0.0 My wife and I are going out to one of my favorite restaurants tonight.	1.0 That sounds fun. Is it a special occasion?
0.0 Not really, just felt like going out. I'm thinking about ordering something I haven't had before, but.... I don't know. I'm weird about trying new foods.	1.0 I understand. Sticking with what you know seems safer.
0.0 I bought a used car a couple months ago and I have to say it's holding up really well for a 6 year old car. It's like new.	1.0 you must be loving it
0.0 I am, You never know what shape a used car really is until you have it for a while.	1.0 true that, you cant be too sure until you use it
0.0 I have a performance review coming up at work in a couple of weeks.	1.0 Tough week ahead. Do you think you have met your expectations thus far?
0.0 Oh yeah. I'm pretty sure the review is going to go well. I might even get a raise!	1.0 Sounds good. Your supervisor must proud of your work and your displayed high self-esteem
0.0 I just got notice that my mortgage payment has gone up this year and i'm so mad about it.	1.0 Oh no! That has so happened to me before! It was only by a couple dollars a month but I SO needed those couple of dollars at the time. I would be MAAADDD
0.0 I am, it went up 20 dollars. 	1.0 Call the bank and get it fixed ASAP! That's got to be so annoying for you!
0.0 I don't play the lottery, ever, but a friend recently gave me a scratch off ticket.	1.0 I buy those like twice a year and never win.
0.0 I won $200!	1.0 Wow! That's awesome! What did you do with it?
0.0 I blew it on online video games, lol.	1.0 Hey, why not? It's unexpected money!
0.0 That is always the best kind.  I still won't be buying lottery tickets, lol.	1.0 Yeah I feel like you get lucky once then it's all downhill from there.
0.0 My girlfriend and I were at a party Friday night. I couldn't find her anywhere, and got worried.	1.0 Where was she?
0.0 In a spare bedroom with her ex, laying on the bed and kissing him.	1.0 Does she have a new ex now?
0.0 She sure does. I am not putting up with that, lol.	1.0 I would not put up with it either 
0.0 I love the rain.  It makes everything feel fresh.	1.0 i love when the rain his the soil in the open field , the smell of wet dirt is just refreshing
0.0 im stoked to go to the park later today	1.0 I bet you are. What are you going to do? 
0.0 take my dog to the park and meet up with some friends!	1.0 sounds like a real good time i hope you enjoy it

0.0 My brother just bought a new car...	1.0 Are you excited for him or jealous? lol 
0.0 Well, I can't help but feel like he only did it to make me feel inferior.	1.0 I feel you! I know its hard having siblings sometimes! Go buy a toy car and park it on top of his. 
0.0 I got a threatening phone call... and now I'm scared.	1.0 Can you report the caller?
0.0 I should be able to. I recognized the voice, it's someone that I used to know.	1.0 Be sure to do it, otherwise they could keep harassing you

0.0 yes i have been very fortunate	1.0 nice.  what do you do for a living
0.0 I went out to the garden and there were a ton of mosquitoes, I couldn't even do any gardening.	1.0 Have you thought about spraying your garden?
0.0 I thought about it but they were coming from the grass around it and I'm worried the dog would get sick if I sprayed the grass	1.0 Perhaps there is an all natural remedy you could try
0.0 i was shocked how nice the weather has been the past couple days	1.0 Same here, I'm in Texas.  Where are you located
0.0 in the midwest!	1.0 Nice! I used to live in St. Paul, MN.  Weather's like a tundra which is why I'm down here
0.0 I was mowing the lawn today and it started storming out of nowhere!	1.0 Were you able to get inside fast?
0.0 No. I was in the middle of the yard and it was sunny, next thing I know it's pouring down rain and I'm soaked.	1.0 Oh wow! That would be annoying!
0.0 im envious of my friends who are off work today	1.0 How did they get off work midweek?
0.0 thats just their normal schedule	1.0 That would be nice but not fun that you don't have the same days off.
0.0 We go on vacation once a year as a family.	1.0 where is your favorite place to go?
0.0 I just love going, when it gets closer to when we are leaving I look forward to it.	1.0 i can imagine, i hope you have a great time this year
0.0 My son starts kindergarten soon. He is my first one.	1.0 I remember when my first child started, I was a nervous wreck.
0.0 They sent out an email saying that he may end up with a substitute teacher until they hire someone. 	1.0 So they don't even have teachers yet? Wow, that's crazy.
0.0 I have no friends and I am lonely	1.0 Have you tried getting out and meeting new people?
0.0 No, it is difficult to meet people in my area because I like in a farm. I only talk to the animals	1.0 What about online friends?
0.0 My friends went to dinner without me	1.0 that would hurt my feelings. are you alright?
0.0 I'm fine, just disappointed mostly	1.0 i totally understand that. i'm sorry.
0.0 I woke up and my car had a flat tire	1.0 That sucks! Did you have a spare on you?
0.0 No, but I was able to get it towed easily enough	1.0 That is good to hear.
0.0 A co-worker was having issues finishing a project	1.0 That's understandable. What kind of project was it? Were you involved?
0.0 It was a major work project, I stepped in to help him	1.0 That's so generous of you. It's people like you that make the work week bearable!
0.0 I was really apprehensive about going to university at the age of 30.	1.0 That's okay, I'm 25 and still in college. How did it go for you? 
0.0 It went pretty well! I got great grades and made friends despite the age difference.	1.0 That's awesome. I'm glad it worked out well for you. :)
0.0 Once I was stranded hours from home in a snowstorm. I ended up going to a stranger's house to wait it out	1.0 Oh wow. I would have been so scared. more of a stranger than the storm
0.0 Well, she was really nice and we had been waiting together in the snow for awhile, so I felt I could trust her.	1.0 Well that was nice. How long were you stuck there
0.0 I was looking at advertisements of my childhood toys recently and felt strangely overwhelmed with emotion.	1.0 Did the ads bring up good memories I hope?

0.0 Once when I was a kid I got caught in a riptide with my sister. It was very scary!	1.0 Sounds frightening! Was this off the coast of a beach or something?
0.0 Yes, Martinique Beach in Nova Scotia. The currents are very strong.	1.0 That is one of my greatest fears. Did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape?
0.0 Yes that's right! I was a strong swimmer so we made it.	1.0 Great to hear that you made it out ok!
0.0 I suppose to be on a committed diet but I kind of cheated today.	1.0 Well, I can understand that. It's very hard to be on a very strict diet, without a break here and now!
0.0 It is my coworkers said they was going to Burger King and I couldn't resist I feel so bad and guilty.	1.0 Well, i am sure you are disappointed, but all you can do now is just get back on the diet again and try to be more dedicated. It's hard, I know!
0.0 I been out of school for about 5 years I am finally going back to college.	1.0 Is this a career change?

0.0 I felt very unpleasant last week when i fell to the ground skateboarding and lots of people saw it happen	1.0 Oh no! You have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail

0.0 Last week at work a coworker tried to take credit for a job that I had completed.	1.0 That's terrible. Did you let others know that you had completed the job?
0.0 I talked to my boss and get it all straightened out, but it was still a really crazy situation.	1.0 I could imagine. Some people stoop low to take credit for what others do.
0.0 I recently had surgery and needed help around the house and my best friend volunteered to help me. 	1.0 what kind of surgery was it?
0.0 I had knee surgery so my normal household chores is hard to keep up but she kept her word and she has helped 2 a week since she is so true to her word I have a great friend.	1.0 Thats awesome! Its great to have friends their for someone.
0.0 My dog chewed my favorite pair of shoes up last week.	1.0 Oh no! Did you scold him?

0.0 Thank you and yes she does the memories together just pleases me so much I cherish these moments.	1.0 She will definitely appreciate it when she gets older too.  I still remember my dad helping me with math homework and cant thank him enough for the help he gave me throughout the years.
0.0 After being married for 8 years to my first wife, I found out she was having an affair behind my back.	1.0 Im sorry about that. How did you find out?
0.0 She came out and told me about it. It was one of the worst times in my life.	1.0 That stinks. Are you still with her or did you leave her?
0.0 My dog just learned how to ring the bell on the doorknob when he needs to go out	1.0 Whoa that is really cool. Did you train him to do that?
0.0 I put the bell on the door so it would ring when it opened and he got used to that, so now he associates the sound with having to go out. 	1.0 That is amazing. Must be a very smart dog.
0.0 I canceled a dinner with a old friend because I was just so tired had a long work week. 	1.0 I understand! As we get older, it's hard to do it all everyday!
0.0 It is I just feel a little guilt-ridden because I told her I had an emergency instead of telling her the truth because she would have tried to talk me into still coming out.	1.0 It happens, but definitely be honest as you would want someone to be honest with you
0.0 Last month my car threw a rod and needed to have the engine overhauled, leaving me without a way to get to work and back.	1.0 Oh no, are you able to afford the repair for it?
0.0 Well, a friend of mine let me borrow his car for a entire month while mine was repaired. He just tossed me the keys and said bring it back when your done.	1.0 What a great friend you have. Definitly get him a gift when you are done.
0.0 I working to save enough money to take my wife on a vacation to Vermont next year. I hope I can save enough.	1.0 I hope you can too. How is it going?
0.0 I'm about half way there. I want to save enough to rent a cottage on one of the lakes up there so I still have a ways to go.	1.0 That's great! I have faith that you can do it.
0.0 I paid off my credit card before buying my house.  I didnt realize how expensive owning would be and after some repairs I owe more than I started with on my card.	1.0 That's really good! Do you think you're ever going to use the card again?
0.0 Im hoping I wont have to.  Unless something major comes up I'm not planning on putting anything on credit again.	1.0 That is wise. I too am trying to pay off my credit card debts. After that, I'm cutting them up.
0.0 I was with some friends and went up to my room.  It was late at night and the lights were off.  When I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.	1.0 That would have really scared me.
0.0 It did scare me.  I let out a scream.  One of my friends went to school for wildlife.  He captured the bat and let it outside which was great.	1.0 I bet you are thankful that your friend was there.
0.0 I brought home a cake for my family, but I ate all of it! Ugh.	1.0 All of it??? Oh no. How bad do you feel right now?
0.0 Uhm, I feel awesome in my tummy, but bad in my heart LOL	1.0 Haha I bet. Im sure they were looking forward to it.
0.0 My roommate was very forgetful.  He would sometimes leave his dogs poop bags inside instead of bringing them out to the garage.	1.0 ewww.
0.0 It was gross.  All of a sudden you would smell something and then notice the bag sitting there.	1.0 Why would it be in the house to begin with? does the dog poop in the house?
0.0 I was watching TV and saw people with a happy family. It breaks my heart.	1.0 You are having trouble with family ?
0.0 My family isn't close, it's depressing.	1.0 Mine isn't either. Are you married?
0.0 I'm so hyped, I'm going to the movies!	1.0 Awesome! What are you going to see?
0.0 Not sure yet, I'll have to ask my friends	1.0 Whatever it is, I hope you have a good time!
0.0 I broke my leg, it's so upsetting.	1.0 Oh no!  How'd you do that?
0.0 I fell off a roof!	1.0 What were you doing on the roof?
0.0 We decided to go fishing last week.	1.0 Did you catch anything?
0.0 No!  And I was so confident that we would!	1.0 Did you at least have fun?
0.0 My daughter graduated high school!	1.0 congrats! you must be proud!
0.0 I am, thanky ou!	1.0 My daughter is only in eigth grade we have a while to go
0.0 I believed my father wouldn't let me down.	1.0 That is good to feel that way. You don't want to feel like someone close to you would let you down. Did it work out for you?
0.0 No, he totally bailed on me, as usual.	1.0 Oh I am sorry. That is sad. Remember that it is not your fault. I would think of the people who have been there for you. 
0.0 I'm about to move and I'm terrified! What if it has bugs? Or mold? Or something else I don't know about?	1.0 Oh gosh, you also scared of bugs?? That's my worst fear
0.0 Yes! I can't imagine them crawling on me when I sleep :/	1.0 I would have a heart attack! 
0.0 I remember eating my Baba's pierogies as a child, so yummy.	1.0 I have no idea what those are!
0.0 They are ukrainian pasta, kind of like stuffed pasta.	1.0 oh ok. I like ravioli is it like that?
0.0 I am so sad I have no pierogies.	1.0 What are pierogies? a type of food?
0.0 They are Ukrainian dumplings.	1.0 Ah nice, I love dumplings, what are in them?
0.0 The milk I drank this mornign went bad!	1.0 That's no good, did you throw it out?
0.0 Yes, but not before I drank some. :/	1.0 Hope you don't get sick!  That would be a bad start to the weekend.
0.0 I once had a fluffy cat named Leo, but he got lymphoma and I had to have him put to sleep.	1.0 Oh, I am so sorry. It has to be the most difficult thing to have to do. I had to do that with my gorgeous lab - I still miss him!
0.0 I'm sorry to hear about your lab as well. They are very sweet dogs.	1.0 Indeed they are. And so are many cats - the farm I used to live on has a ginger tom. He's quite the character and used to visit me regularly!
0.0 I love ginger cats! Leo was a ginger, and I have one right now named Chunk.	1.0 This fella is called Oliver. He's a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers. He would bring half eaten ones to my door!
0.0 Yikes! That doesn't sound pleasant, but I know they do that to try to show you they like you. They think you appreciate the gifts.	1.0 Oh, I shouldn't be ungrateful, lol! At least he kills them before delivering them. A friends cat used to deliver live mice into the bathtub!
0.0 I was so happy!  I have been working so hard for this company since I started so this is a great sign in my opinion!  	1.0 Did you get a promotion?
0.0 Not yet but I did get a raise!  If the company takes over I will get to be in charge of the helpdesk though!	1.0 Wow, great job!
0.0 I'm really scared to go back to school.	1.0 Oh no!  What has you scared?
0.0 It's all new to me, I've never done it before	1.0 It'll be okay I promise.  First few days will be weird but you'll slip in no problem once you adjust to your schedule.
0.0 My mother died, I'm a mess.	1.0 oh dang thats so horrible
0.0 Thank you :(	1.0 it gets better with time but it must be hard
0.0 I really miss Hastings.  I spent so much time in that store when I first started college.  Both just hanging out and working.	1.0 I remember that store! I loved going shopping there, was it your first job?
0.0 It wasn't my first but it was my most favorite retail job I had	1.0 Yeah, I bet, it looked like a fun place to work.  Especially for a college job.
0.0 I pray I can do well in school	1.0 Are you having any specific problem areas?
0.0 Not yet, but I haven't started yhet	1.0 Okay. I hope you do well too.
0.0 I've really wanted a Ford Excursion for a long time.	1.0 Interesting, those things are huge, Do they even make them any more?
0.0 They haven't made them for quite a few years.  But I met a guy that just picked one up in the last few days!	1.0 Do you have a large family, or do you just like the idea of a large SUV?
0.0 We don't have a huge family, just 5.  But my wife does daycare, and our current vehicle only has 5 seats, so she's stuck at home fairly frequently.	1.0 5 is fairly large i would say. I hope you get your giant car one day.
0.0 I'm scared to go to the cottage	1.0 It is a big change. What is scaring you?
0.0 I don't like bugs!	1.0 I hate bugs too. You should exterminate before you move in
0.0 I am sad my cousin is moving away.	1.0 Is it really far?
0.0 Yes, another country	1.0 oh no. im sorry to hear that
0.0 I had some friends over and went upstairs to my room.  All the lights were off and when I left my room a bat flew at me and landed on my leg.	1.0 Well, that would be terrifying! Were you afraid that a vampire was there?
0.0 Hahahaha, that piece hadnt crossed my mind although it should have with all the vampire movies I had seen!  I let out a scream and one of my friends captured the bat and let it outside to be free.	1.0 Well, that would be very creepy! They would hear my scream in the next town over!
0.0 I was totally ready for my garage sale	1.0 You were ready? That's good to hear.
0.0 Yes and we made $1026.25!	1.0 Aweomse.  Treat yo self.gif
0.0 I have an interview coming up.  Its for a position that someone else already has but I need to do this interview to get my name out there and let the higher ups know I want to move into management.	1.0 Are you prepared?
0.0 I am prepared for it.  I'll be a lot happier once it is over.	1.0 I bet. Good luck to you
0.0 I went to work the other day, and I was the only person in the office.	1.0 Where you supposed to be there? If so, then that is a nice feeling.
0.0 Yeah, everyone else was just gone.  It was nice for a while, but got a bit lonely.	1.0 Oh I see. That could make the time go slow also. 
0.0 I am starting back at school next month. I am excited about getting back into my classes.	1.0 That's great. What classes are you taking?
0.0 I'm a computer science student. The one I'm most excited about is Microprocessors.	1.0 That's pretty cool... Are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming?
0.0 I want to be a software developer I think, so I like the programming.	1.0 You should go all out and get a EE degree to go with it.  You can do microprocessor design.
0.0 I really like school, so you never know what I might decide to go for next. Thank you for the advice.	1.0 Any time. Have a good weekend :D
0.0 My dog just died in my arms.	1.0 Did that happen tonight?
0.0 No, it was a few years ago.	1.0 Well, it must've been something you said.
0.0 My step-daughter just turned 16 in the past week.	1.0 Did she have a party?
0.0 We're actually having it this coming weekend.	1.0 Does she have her license yet?
0.0 No . . . that's a long story involving her idiot father.  I'm somewhat glad, though, as she can't seem to set her phone down.	1.0 Well, there's no hurry in driving, is there? What does she do mostly on her phone? Text??
0.0 Text, video chat, watch some goofball put makeup on, and shop.  Things most teenagers do, I suppose.	1.0 Does she play any sports?
0.0 I watch my girlfriends dog every once in a while and she just isnt getting potty training.  She is a little over 5 months old and some weeks she does a great job and the next week she'll go to the bathroom everywhere but outside.	1.0 That's super frustrating! I've only ever had outside pets so I can't really offer advice, but it's one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can't really be upset with the dog since it doesn't know any better.
0.0 I do understand that part too.  I actually got a puppy a couple months before her so I went through this all.  I just wish her puppy listened as well as mine because he took a couple months as has been doing great since.  I know it'll click eventually...I just wish shed hurry up :)	1.0 It'll be well worth it when she gets the hang of it, but urgh. Bathroom problems are why I don't think I want a kid anytime soon!
0.0 I was shocked by my present.	1.0 You got a present? How lovely! What was the occasion?
0.0 It was my anniversary.	1.0 Well, happy anniversary! What was your present?
0.0 Humanity is the worst.	1.0 I agree.. Did something happen?
0.0 No, just frustrated	1.0 I'm sorry.. Not everyone is bad.  Just a lot of people.
0.0 My mom spent a lot of money buying me a computer for my birthday	1.0 That was nice
0.0 Yes, I love my mom and I will give her something even better for her birthday!	1.0 Do you have anything in mind?
0.0 My old roommate never did any dishes.  He also didnt wash any food off the plates so we had a sink full of dirty dishes and rotting food at all time.  It was miserable living there.	1.0 So, I take you left to live someplace else?
0.0 Haha yes, I ended up saving up then moving out and buying my own place.  I wont miss the flies sitting around the kitchen and he's still just as messy...now its on his own though instead of with other people.	1.0 Just remember to never invite you ex-roomate to your new place, EVER!!!!!!
0.0 I recently tried to get a manager's job in my company, two others and myself were the last three in the running for the job.	1.0 Very nice, congrats on making it that far. I actually was in the same situation about a week ago.  How do you feel you match up to the others?
0.0 I had much more experience than both of them, but ended up not getting the job. I am still pretty upset about it.	1.0 I would be upset too.  However, I wouldnt get discouraged though.  There may be another opportunity even better that comes along soon.
0.0 My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but he made it through college	1.0 That's great, it's good to see people finish what they start. You must be very proud.
0.0 I was.  I know how hard it was for him so it was great seeing that hard work pay off in the long run.	1.0 Well, hopefully there will be nothing but great things for him in his future.
0.0 My little brother graduated not too long ago.  He had to work hard but made it through it.	1.0 I am so glad to hear that.  Did he find a job?
0.0 He did!  He actually just started a new job that he loves and is related to his degree.	1.0 That is good to hear.  What will he be doing?
0.0 My girlfriend is moving in this weekend.  It will be great finally living together.	1.0 Oh that's wonderful! How long have you two been dating?
0.0 We have been dating almost a year.  I'm just excited to take this next step in the relationship.	1.0 It's a huge step, congratulations! 
0.0 My girlfriends aunt just died.  She wasnt close to her but is still devastated because of the impact it had on her sister.  I'm doing whatever I can to help them both.	1.0 Sometimes deaths affect us even when we're not really close.
0.0 Thats very true.  I know she feels bad for not keeping as close contact as she could have with her aunt now.	1.0 Guilt can be a terrible thing to live with.
0.0 My friend and coworker hasnt been coming into work.  People are starting to talk but its hard to stick up for him when he only comes in once or twice a week.	1.0 Is he sick or just being lazy?
0.0 A little bit of both.  He has bad anxiety but he also has told me he just doesnt like going into work.	1.0 I hope he can get the help he needs and maybe a job he enjoys more.
0.0 One time during Kindergarten, I peed myself because the teacher did not let me go to the restroom	1.0 Oh, well that's awful on a little person! I never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom!
0.0 Thanks! Luckily I am potty trained now!	1.0 LOL, well, that's good to know. So am I!
0.0 One of my well knows patients that has horrible diabetes came in today for a follow up. 	1.0 Is your patient improving an following good medical advice?
0.0 Yes. After 3 years of working with her she finally started to take her medication as prescribed as well as watch her carb and sugar intake. I checked her blood sugar today and to my suprise it was normal!	1.0 That would be a surprise.  A lot of people are not dedicated enough to change their condition, especially those with diabetes.
0.0 The first time my girlfriend slept over I farted on her leg in the middle of the night.  She knew it happened but didnt say anything.  She also doesnt know that I know.	1.0 Thats... uh... strange?
0.0 It was embarrassing but I think that she stayed with me is after is a good sign!	1.0 I think so, you're two peas in a pod.
0.0 I'm trying to get some work done and my dog just wants to play!  I love him to death but he needs to learn to be independent at times too!	1.0 Pets are great, but they can be a bit needy for attention at times. It is great, but not when you are busy and trying to get things done.
0.0 Thats very true.  After our first conversation I might have to take a break and play with him a bit.  I might have to log off and go on a sort walk to tire him out.	1.0 A walk will definitely help. He will probably be ready for a nap when you get back, then you can get some work done.
0.0 One time when I was letting my cat outside, it ran out into the streets and got ran over	1.0 Oh my god! That's terrible!
0.0 Then I woke up, it was all a dream.	1.0 Oh that's so great!
0.0 my son just won first place at his championship swim meet!	1.0 That's amazing!  Congratulations!  Swimming can be tough
0.0 Thank you! He takes to it like a fish in water. HaHA!	1.0 LOL I bet you use that line all the time!  I love it
0.0 One time when using the public restroom, I had toilet paper hanging from my shoe when I went outside	1.0 Oh man! I hope no one noticed. 
0.0 Unfortunately I kept getting looks! It's alright though!	1.0 I'm glad that it all worked out!
0.0 I have a goal I want to get on here tonight but my dog really wants to play.  I feel bad that I'm not playing with him but would really like to hit my goal before I do.	1.0 Oh, I bet you are really torn.
0.0 I am, I would think I'll be done pretty soon and then take him for a nice long walk.	1.0 I'm sure he will love that. I bet you will see the joy just shining in his eyes.
0.0 My girlfriend broke up with me recently	1.0 That's one of the hardest parts of life. What happened??
0.0 We drifted apart it seems	1.0 That is hard! Relationships are hard work.
0.0 A friend of mine drove me to work when my car broke down	1.0 That is great of them, did you do anything to pay them back?
0.0 I took him out to dinner later on, he's a good friend	1.0 That is nice of you, glad you have supportive friends!
0.0 I saw a mouse run across my kitchen floor	1.0 Aw poor mouse. I have had a few before..We actually rescued a few from our cat :/ 
0.0 I hope I can catch it at some point	1.0 They have live traps to catch and release that are only a couple bucks. Mice really are sweet natured.
0.0 A co-worker of mine was late with work materials	1.0 What happened to them?
0.0 I eventually got them, but it almost cost me this project I've been working on	1.0 Good, sorry you were inconvenienced, hope things get more consistent!
0.0 I was watching my girlfriends son the other weekend and was trying to think of an activity we could do together.  I decided on cooking and got everything before he came over.	1.0 that sounds like fun. for some reason kids really enjoy cooking.
0.0 Yeah, he seemed to have a good time.  We made cheese too which was a first for both of us.  It turned out pretty good too which was nice.	1.0 that sounds like fun. i want to try to make mozzerella

0.0 I was walking around my office and someone spilled coffee on me	1.0 That is bad. What did you do after that?
0.0 I went to the bathroom to clean up, it was a new shirt as well	1.0 Did he say sorry?
0.0 When I came home, a TV show I had set to record was all ready to go	1.0 What show was it?
0.0 Black Mirror	1.0 is that the one with Bryce Dallas Howard?
0.0 I keep remembering my old college days	1.0 Oh? What about them?
0.0 Just how fun and carefree they were.	1.0 That's true. Any memory in particular?
0.0 I'm spending my first summer in Massachusetts. It's a lot hotter than I expected it to be.	1.0 Is it really? How hot is it there?
0.0 The hottest it got was 99 degrees. It has been in the mid 80s mostly, but I was expecting cooler weather in New England.	1.0 That is hot, but it is a bit hotter where I live here
0.0 I was all alone when my family left for the weekend.	1.0 Did you feel lonely, or were you happy to have some time to yourelf?
0.0 A bit sad. More bored than anything.	1.0 That is tough when you're not used to being alone.  What did you end up doing?
0.0 I'm looking forward to meeting with some friends on the weekend	1.0 Oh that's cool!  What do you all have planned?
0.0 Probably go hiking and visit some local towns	1.0 Well that sounds like a fun little trip.
0.0 After a long day I finally got my dog settled down and I dont have any work.  It feels nice to just sit for a little bit.	1.0 thats nice to be able to relax
0.0 Have you had a good day?  Hopefully you dont have a busy weekend and can relax a little bit.	1.0 everyday is a good day!
0.0 I feel ready for the coming work week	1.0 Really? You must really like you job then
0.0 Yeah, I think I have all my work materials set	1.0 Good for you! I hope you  have good week!
0.0 I had an online interview today for a teaching position and I nailed it!	1.0 Awesome! I am happy for you!
0.0 Thanks! Regardless I am a bit nervous. There are a lot of things to remember and I don't want to look like a fool on the job.	1.0 I am sure you will do fine! Good Luck!
0.0 I found out recently that my girlfriend's cat has cancer and we cannot afford the operation to remove it.	1.0 Oh I am so sorry. Best thing to do is be there for her.
0.0 Thank you for your sympathies. Have you ever dealt with losing a pet?	1.0 I have and it really hard. It just takes time But a good support system makes it way better.
0.0 My girlfriend was having a bad day at work a few days ago.	1.0 how did she handle it
0.0 Well, I sent her some pizza and it was so unexpected it turned her whole day around!	1.0 well that was nice of you
0.0 I spent two hours studying material for an interview.	1.0 did it help?

0.0 To my girlfriend's place. Luckily it only lasted a week, and my Mom is super caring and loving. She took me back in against his wishes.	1.0 That was so awesome of your mom :)
0.0 Walking home alone from school one day, three young adults jumped in front of me and yelled in my face.	1.0 Why did they do that?

0.0 My daughter is officially all grown up she is leaving and going off to college next week. 	1.0 Are you excited or will it be lonely?

0.0 Some restaurants just have the worst workers they are so rude and mean to us the customers. 	1.0 I agree. I dont know why they work in the service industry if they don't like to be nice
0.0 Exactly what is even worse is the managers who are just as rude, I get so upset I had this happen to me at Wendy's staff was so unprofessional. 	1.0 Fast food employees are the worst sometimes... it's like we bother them
0.0 I will officially be a first time home owner next month. 	1.0 How exciting!!!  I bet you are thinking already about  how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn, etc..

0.0 Do you have any experience about it	1.0 Any experience with what?
0.0 Anything that made you happy	1.0 Yes some things
0.0 I packed a sandwich before I went to work	1.0 Are you trying to save money by not eating out at work?
0.0 Yup, and I am too lazy to drive out to a restaurant!	1.0 Well, it can save you a bunch of money!  Plus you gain the time that you would normally spend going out somewhere and you can use that time to have more of a break.
0.0 One time I saw poop smeared all over the public restroom	1.0 Oh my! I bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there. 
0.0 Yup the smell was disgusting!	1.0 Yikes! Why in the world would somebody do that?
0.0 One time I looked at the mirror and thought I saw a monster	1.0 Whoa! That is really scary! I've felt weird sensations like that before.
0.0 Yeah. Unfortunately, it was a monster! I am just ugly!	1.0 No! I'm sure you are not as monster-ish as you think!
0.0 My mom spent a lot of money to buy me a computer	1.0 Aw that's nnice of her
0.0 Yup! She worked hard for like 3 weeks to save up for it! I love her!	1.0 Moms are the best
0.0 One time while I was camping, there was a giant rattle snake trying to attack us	1.0 Did you kill the snake?
0.0 Nope! I packed up and went straight home!	1.0 That is too bad, will you ever camp again?
0.0 I had business meeting about a year ago where I had to rely a lot on my co-worker.	1.0 Did they do a good job?

0.0 One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and won $20!	1.0 That's awesome! It would be amazing to win a million one day. One can dream.
0.0 Yup, I am going to buy another one just because of you! I hope I win!	1.0 That's great. I hope you do! Maybe this time you can get $40. But gamble only in moderation!
0.0 I was upset when my family kept leaving me on vacation	1.0 That is really upsetting!
0.0 It was. I just wanted some quality family time.	1.0 Well forget them! If they don't care about you you don't need to care about them
0.0 My cousin and I used to beat eachother with sticks.	1.0 for fun?
0.0 Yeah. We called it the box game and walked around inside of a refrigerator box for protection.	1.0 well that sounds pretty fun!

0.0 2 years	1.0 wow thats great!
0.0 I was grossed out when I saw someone vomit outside a bar.	1.0 Drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general.
0.0 For sure. it was not a pretty sight.	1.0 Some people can't hold their liquor.
0.0 Life is a lot better when you can eat solid food. Never get your jaw wired shut it sucks.	1.0 I can imagine. What happend that you got your jaw wired?
0.0 I got punched while drunk without a mouth guard years ago - still think about it !	1.0 Man that sounds aweful.
0.0 Life is good right now for me too	1.0 Nice.  Always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can't touch you
0.0 Right just staying active, don't need much money, minimal drama. Easy	1.0 Absolutely

0.0 I've noticed that it's easier to be happy while not around someone all the time.	1.0 Would you say you're more of an introvert?
0.0 August is way too hot.	1.0 Especially in the south
0.0 Right. I live as north as you're gonna get in the US and it still sucks.	1.0 Oh wow, that does sound horrible
0.0 GED test was super easy. I was confident that I would pass it	1.0 did you find out the results?
0.0 Yeah I crushed	1.0 dang thats awesome!

0.0 I still work there, but just part time now. I am studying Computer Science.	1.0 Oh wonderful! One of the best fields to be in right now

0.0 lol you just haven't came across the right person yet. It is incredible I arranged and had them a surprise dinner party it turned out very nice.	1.0 Thats sweet. I bet they enjoyed it
0.0 Here in Florida the traffic and wrecks is bad and always happening. 	1.0 I hate bad traffic, did you get in an accident?
0.0 Due to a reckless driver running the red light, but most wrecks I have witnessed come from careless drivers or drivers driving slow in the fast lane and get tail ended I get so irritated I swear. 	1.0 That's the worst, I hate when people are careless.
0.0 I get so angry when people stand me up it's so rude.	1.0 I know what you mean

0.0 Professional settings is suppose to get along and be great but not my place of work staff fight like cats and dogs there. 	1.0 That is awful.  I agree.  A professional setting is supposed to be ... well, professional.  What steps are being taken to correct that?
0.0 We have a team building coming up and let's hope this works which I predict it will be some type of good outcome. 	1.0 I agree.  I hope it will be.  Team building, communication, and professionalism will all help a company.  I think this is why so many companies fail.  
0.0 I just drove 12 hours back from my parents' house. It wasn't so bad though, because I actually packed everything I needed for once. I was able to minimize the amount of stops I took and cut two hours off of the total time it took!	1.0 Wow, you do really live far from your parents. Do you go to college or work?
0.0 I work. We moved far from where they grew up when I was young, and they ended up moving back for retirement. 	1.0 I see. Well, it seems as people get older they want to go back to places which reminds them of past. Nostalgia probably helps them cope with passing life
0.0 I was pretty bummed to find out that my favorite coworker is transferring to a different department.	1.0 I can see how that would be a downer.  Will you still get to see them?
0.0 Once in a while, here and there.	1.0 At least they aren't gone completely, but I can understand how that would affect your day to day work life.
0.0 I prequalified for a mortgage last week online. The bank I applied with has called me 3 times a day ever since. I'm getting pretty frustrated.	1.0 i would be really annoyed myself, why so many frequent calls ?
0.0 I'm not sure. This is my first time shopping for a mortgage, so I'm not sure if it's normal or not.	1.0 i know ever since i purchased a new car, i know for a fact i did not read the fine print but insurance companys call me almost every day multiple times a day , its really annoying 
0.0 I watched Wimbledon for the first time last summer. Those tennis players are SO GOOD!	1.0 I know right! my parents love tennis, so I grw up watching it.
0.0 I had played a little bit growing up, but never watched it professionally. 	1.0 were you ever any good at it?
0.0 It was so life-like and I have such fond memories of playing in there.  My stepdad worked for pillsbury and brought home dough and I would pretend I was baking.	1.0 Good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of. Can you bake now for real?
0.0 Yes somewhat, although with all that practice in childhood I should be much better.   I miss my stepdad so much.   I have nothing but fond memories of him.	1.0 Are you still in contact with him?
0.0 I looked at a house I really liked last week, but just found out it was taken off the market.	1.0 Oh that sucks. I hate when that happens.
0.0 Yeah, it'll be okay though. There's always something else that will come available.	1.0 I bet the next house you look at will be amazing and even better than that one.
0.0 I had to drive 12 hours straight last week. For once it wasn't terrible, because I packed everything I needed. Took two hours fewer than it normally does!	1.0 That sounds exhausting! Were you driving for work or just taking a vacation?
0.0 Vacation. Went to go visit my parents.	1.0 I'm sure the drives worth it since you get to spend time with the family.
0.0 I came home from work, expecting an empty apartment. My boyfriend was home from his trip a day early!	1.0 Was he alone?
0.0 Yes, I was very excited to see him.	1.0 Cool. Did you do something special?
0.0 I got a promotion at work! I'm so excited!	1.0 Congrats
0.0 Thank you!	1.0 Do you get a raise?
0.0 My bank has called me three times a day for the past week, and I'm tired of it.	1.0 Probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account
0.0 No, I prequalified for a mortgage, and they've been wanting me to speak to a loan specialist ever since.	1.0 Are you interested in mortgage for now?
0.0 My roommate leaves her leftovers in the fridge for a disgusting amount of time.	1.0 Oh that is really gross! Have you talked to her about it?
0.0 No, I don't feel like it's my place to tell her what to do.	1.0 If you share the fridge, I'd let her know if it causes an odor or might affect the other food.
0.0 I came home expecting an empty apartment, but my boyfriend had come home a day early from his trip!	1.0 cool. did he have gifts?
0.0 No, but I'm not big on gifts.	1.0 Oh. I am lol
0.0 Do you feel anything like that	1.0 Like what? Bad or miserable?
0.0 sad, when you see beggar in the street	1.0 Yes indeed. Seeing people less fortunate than me makes go to pieces
0.0 Next month my wife and I are going on our first vacation, I can hardly wait.	1.0 Wow. enjoy your own time.
0.0 I will, it is going to be great to get away together.	1.0 Yeah, you're right. Hope you've memorable vacation.
0.0 My ex boyfriend and I started having trouble getting along and we were under a lot of stress over money.   After awhile of this he started putting a password on his cell phone so I couldnt get in to see his messages.  THat was the first sign!	1.0 Wao, thats really not cool
0.0 NO, not cool at all.  We ended up breaking up for a bit and he didnt waste any time before seeing this girl.   I wasted four years of my life for that to happen.   	1.0 He doesnt deserve you, so wipe your tears
0.0 I found myself suddenly by myself and it seemed as if all the people I had become friends with were no longer wanting to still be friends.  I mostly met all of them through him when we got together, and when he left me he told them not to speak to me anymore and they listened.	1.0 That's sad. But I'm sure they stil want to be firends with you too
0.0 I dont think they do.  He was an abusive guy and he didnt want me to have them as friends and he would make up lies about me .  I dont think it was so much the lies he made up because they knew they were not true.  I think they were just loyal to him.	1.0 Posibly. Sounds like you are better off without him though
0.0 I love it when the buildbuilding is comingfrom me	1.0 That's awesome, I wish I could build my own house.
0.0 Is the conversation over? You are welcome then.	1.0 Well thank you as well.
0.0 Her name was Lily and she was a pit bull, my favorite breed.   I loved her so much.  We did everything together.  She would go wherever I did.	1.0 Did she die recently?
0.0 No she had to go to the humane society when my ex boyfriend and I broke up.   I had no choice, and he did it just to hurt me.  Lily would go swimming with me, ride on our boat etc.  When she was just a pup she would sit on my lap as i rode the four wheeler. 	1.0 Oh wow! Thats so sad, I know animals can be like kids to use. I'm so sorry
0.0 He was originally suspended at 17 when he again got got with a little bit of weed.  They have a law here in missouri called 21 and under law.  Automatically get suspended for a year if ur a minor in possession.	1.0 That can ruin a persons life.
0.0 I know it can which is why I was so worried at court.  THe judge looked at him and said son you need to hire you a lawyer.  I  throw people in jail for things like this.	1.0 That is such a mess.
0.0 The best thing happened at work today!	1.0 Tell me more, sounds exciting! 
0.0 Well we have these weekly meetings about our goals and today I was recognized by name in front of everyone for a job well done.	1.0 Good on you! You finally got recognition for your hard work
0.0 Ugh! Tonight was such a bummer.	1.0 Oh no what happened?
0.0 I was going to go to a concert but couldn't get myself to go by myself at the last minute. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.	1.0 What concert was it?
0.0 It was an annual block party we have here with a local lineup of musicians. I really liked the lineup!	1.0 That probably would have been fun.
0.0 The aftermath was awful.  Trash and debris was everywhere and we were homeless.  We lived out in the country and it took some time before red cross came out to do their report and get help to us.	1.0 That sounds terrible. I hope you're okay now.
0.0 I am doing better now but it was really hard times.  We had moved everything up higher as we never expected our whole house to go.  Unfortunately we had all our belongings in the house as well.	1.0 Well all the matters is that no one was hurt. You can buy property again but not lives.
0.0 I ordered a new phone last week, and when the box got here it was empty.	1.0 That is so messed up!
0.0 Yeah, I was pretty upset, especially when they initially refuse to refund my money.	1.0 I would be so angry.
0.0 A few years back I had to bury my dog, who had died at the age of 13.	1.0 Oh wow, What kind of dog was it? I'm so sorry that must've been super hard
0.0 He was a lab.  It broke my heart, to be honest.	1.0 I can imagine. I haven't had an animal die yet but my cat is 13 and I'm dreading the day
0.0 I thought I would never get the chance or opportunity to better my life as well as my childrens.  I cant wait till I get that degree	1.0 That's wonderful that you are pursuing a degree. What is it in?
0.0 I am getting a counseling degree to help abused women.  I feel I would make a good counselor since I  have been in a few abusive relationships myself.	1.0 That is great that you have been able to overcome and do this to help others. You can really make a difference! 
0.0 I saw a video game trailer recently that really brought me back!	1.0 Yeah? Which game was it for?
0.0 The new Spyro Remastered game coming out. Seeing it really reminded me of how I used to play the original all day with an old friend of mine.	1.0 Nice. The original Spyro is a classic.
0.0 I had a flat on the way to work this morning, and the jack handle was missing from my car.	1.0 Oh no. What did you do?
0.0 I used a screwdriver to work the jack. It sucked, lol.	1.0 Lol, well done for attempting it. Did you make it to work on time?
0.0 I just celebrated my birthday and it was so much better than usual.	1.0 That's great. What made it so special this year?
0.0 I usually don't do much to celebrate but this year a friend of mine got all my other friends together to throw a party for me without me knowing. It was a great time.	1.0 Sounds like fun! I'm glad you had a happy birthday.
0.0 My wife and I have tried to have a baby for over three years, and had given up hope.  Two weeks ago, we found out she was pregnant.	1.0 I am so happy for you! Congrats!
0.0 Thank you!  We were both pretty shocked by the news, lol.	1.0 I wish you nothing but the best!
0.0 I was in an extremely dangerous abusive relationship at the time and I knew he was intending to put her in the middle of it all.   He intended to use her for leverage over me .	1.0 It sounds like you're talking about two different people there instead of just one person.  I'm a little confused.
0.0 Oh my I am getting ahead of myself.  I was referring to when I had to put my daughter emerson up for adoption in 2011.  	1.0 Ouch that sucks. I'm sorry to hear that.
0.0 Ugh! My friend is definitely getting on my nerves today.	1.0 Why what happened? Are y'all on a trip?
0.0 We made plans to catch up but never set a time. I tried to contact him to figure out what time and he never got back to me. I was looking forward to catching up.	1.0 Oh wow, so he basically ghosted you? I would be mad too
0.0 Yes, I pray not to be found or trapped like they trapped me to stab unknown man.	1.0 That sounds very bizarre.
0.0 Serious, that has being my worse situation so far	1.0 I hope you are okay.
0.0 My car window was broken when i walked up to my car this morning!	1.0 That is so messed up!
0.0 Yeah it is! Im going to have to spend money I didnt have. Im so upset right now.	1.0 I hope this doesn't happen again.
0.0 I really felt like a fool last night.	1.0 Oh my, what did you do, may I ask?
0.0 I was playing a board game with a few friends and I ended up spilling my entire drink all over the table. 	1.0 That does not sound good. It must have been so embarrassing!
0.0 Work was not a good experience today.	1.0 Oh no, what happened?
0.0 I had to explain how a bunch of things work in front of a lot of people. I'm not a fan of talking in front of a crowd.	1.0 I hate public speaking too!
0.0 When i moved to dallas I felt I would have the time of my life after living in a small town, but after a couple of weeks i got homesick.	1.0 Dallas is a really fast city.
0.0 yeah it is. I dont know anybody and my classmates all have jobs. so I get to be at home by myself alot	1.0 I'm sorry, things will get better.
0.0 I'm really excited about this weekend!	1.0 What are your plans?
0.0 A friend of mine has been out of the country for a year and he has finally come back. We're going to catch up.	1.0 Thats aweosme! Is he going to be staying with you?
0.0 So my sister drove my car to run an errand and got a ticket! She doesnt have her license	1.0 That is terrible. What happened then?
0.0 Well not much. Its just I feel bad because I told her I would take her but got so busy. Maybe im the one that should have got the ticket. not her	1.0 I understand. My mistaske always happened.
0.0 Financial troubles are sometimes the worst! Ugh.	1.0 Those are so stressful. Just take it step by step and you can get on track. 
0.0 You really have to. Luckily, my family was able to help me out and get me back on my feet. It's definitely nice to have people who are willing to help.	1.0 That makes all the difference. I am glad you were able to get out of that position. 
0.0 so my brother will be the first out of 4 kids of my parents to have a baby and today is going to be the gender revealing party. 	1.0 You must be really excited for it! Do you think its going to be girl or boy?
0.0 we all want a boy so we are all cant wait to find out what it is. everyone is so impatient about it, but today is the day.	1.0 Well, it will great either way as long as the baby is healthy! 
0.0 I'm looking forward to how chill this weekend will be.	1.0 Do you plan do something this weekend?
0.0 Quite the opposite, really. I just paid all my bills and have not really any plans. Sometimes it's nice to just not have that stress and relax.	1.0 Yes. It is sometime nice to just rest at home.
0.0 So this year will be the first time I been to a haunted house. Im get scared easilty so Im kinda worried. I promised my friend I would go with her. 	1.0 That sounds like fun Do you know who haunts it?
0.0 I dont know, but I feel I should not go, but again I promised my friend I would go. I dont know wha to do now. 	1.0 Well, if you promised I would try to go. I'm sure it'll be fine. 
0.0 Me and this girl have been dating for awhile now, so I think Im going to ask her to be my girlfriend. 	1.0 Nice! You must be pretty confident she will say yes.
0.0 Yes I agree. I feel that way about it. You know me too well. 	1.0 I hope it goes well for you and brings happiness to you both.
0.0 My sister's cat got sick and had to be put down last week. Feels bad.	1.0 That sounds terrible. But hopefully it isnt suffering any more. 
0.0 She had stomach cancer, so she was in a lot of pain. Definitely the right thing to do	1.0 I agree, just remember her for all the good memories. 
0.0 I have a huge exam coming up tomorrow.	1.0 Have you been studying? That is intimidating but I bet you'll do great! What's the subject?
0.0 It's for a PC Architecture class. I'm feeling really good about it though since I studied really hard all week!	1.0 What an interesting course! I hope you do really well. Exams can be so scary- they can cause such anxiety. 
0.0 There are maggots all over my building's garbage bin this morning. I got one on my arm when I walked by	1.0 That is very bad. Did you complaint to the landlord?
0.0 They don't care. They live upstairs and are very dirty people. I'm moving as soon as I get a job!	1.0 I understand. The best thing is to move.
0.0 Coming home driving in the rain my car hydroplaned on the freeway!	1.0 That's awful! I'm always scared that's going to happen to me when it's raining
0.0 I agree and thank god I was the only car on the freeway , otherwise It would be a different story!	1.0 You got lucky for sure!  I can't imagine how scary that would be
0.0 I'm amazed on how many people came to the parade considering the rain!	1.0 Really, where was this parade at? I'm in Missouri and it was absolutely pouring on Friday
0.0 I'm here down south and It has been pouring as well, but that didnt stop people from coming! Im shocked. 	1.0 I usually don't let a little rain stop me unless it's ridiculous!
0.0 I just saw a commercial about the Rescue Animals. Everytime I see it it makes me so sad. 	1.0 oh no. feeling empathy towards them just shows you're normal. There's a lot of people in your boat
0.0 Yea. It reminds me of my old dog that was a rescue. So many memories. I want to go get one actually. 	1.0 whats preventing you?
0.0 I started nursing school and work full time, so I wont give much time to it. I want it to be a happy dog. 	1.0 you sound too kind. You'd be a great dog mother/father!
0.0 I love mystery boxes in games! Unfortunately I usually don't get anything good.	1.0 That sounds fun!  What are they exactly?
0.0 Almost any game that has an online component! Like right now I play The Secret World and it has mystery boxes.	1.0 It sounds like you really enjoy it!  Good for you!
0.0 So I will be going to see my mom after 2 years of not seeing her since starting school! I cant wait	1.0 How exciting! She must be thrilled too
0.0 Yes she is. We are all so excited to finally hang out! We have so much planned	1.0 I hope you guys have the best time!
0.0 So the role I worked so hard for went to a person who could care less about the play! 	1.0 That unfortunate.  Are you feeling a little jealous?
0.0 I guess you can say that! What a day!	1.0 I hate it when stuff like that happens. 
0.0 I agree. Maybe I will act like him next time. 	1.0 Haha, nooooo... don't do that.   There are too many of those people in the world as it is.
0.0 Yeah your right. I will stick to my little envious rant and go about my day	1.0 Sounds like the best course to me :)
0.0 Once, I went camping with my family. We saw many animals and a beautiful creek. It was a happy time.	1.0 That sounds so great. Being in nature makes you feel so good. 
0.0 It does! I really hope we get to go camping again this fall.	1.0 You should just make a plan and do it. It sounds like it is worthwhile. 
0.0 We order Chinese food last. The order was completely wrong but the lady seemed very helpful when we called.	1.0 That sucks, sorry to hear that. Did you get a refund?
0.0 We didn't get a refund but they were able to fix the order. I was really craving Chinese!	1.0 Hopefully they get your order correct the next time you order there!
0.0 I ate a lot of my kid's Halloween candy. I told her the candy was old and I had to throw it away.	1.0 Did it taste good?
0.0 It was really good! She had a lot of candy. I was hoping she wouldn't notice some missing!	1.0 Did it taste good?
0.0 two weeks back i celebrated my birthday and do you know what my office colleagues planed for me	1.0 Were you suprised that they did this for you?
0.0 yes and i am quiet happy that they also brought my wife who stays in london for party to surprise me	1.0 Wow! How happy you must be. I be that day brought you lost of excitement. 
0.0 yes it took me with a surprise how well my colleagues planned for me	1.0 You must have great co workers. I bet your happy everyday you go to work
0.0 So my childhood dog died last week. My mother called me with the news. 	1.0 oh so sad , what happened to it
0.0 He died of old age. He could barely walk so they put him down. Yeah pretty bad news. It made my day blue	1.0 it must must a very much hard time for you and your family 
0.0 Yes it is. He is in a better place now. 	1.0 yes , he be rest in peace
0.0 We went camping in the mountain. We did not know it was bear season. There were a lot of hunters and hunting dogs in the area. They were chasing the bears into one area	1.0 I would be so scared. I think I might have to leave. Did the bears bother anyone?
0.0 Luckily, the hunters kept them around a mile from camp. It was still very hard to sleep! We heard dogs barking at the bears all night!	1.0 Were you in a tent or a camper? I hope you kept your food locked up tightly.
0.0 We were in a tent and all of food was in a Yeti! I made sure everyone put their food away and burned leftovers in the fire.	1.0 Glad everyone is safe! You were very smart.
0.0 We had a doberman for over 8 years. He passed away last spring. It was a hard time for our family.	1.0 Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I know pets can be like one of the family. 
0.0 They are like having another child! I hope to have another doberman one day. They're really good dogs.	1.0 You should adopt a rescue dog. That would be great for the family. 
0.0 last week i visited a restaurant and found a insect in the burger which i ordered	1.0 That's disgusting. What did you do about it?
0.0 i immediately raised an alarm about the issue and complained to store manager	1.0 Did you get a refund at least? I would never visit that restaurant ever again if I were you!
0.0 We have homeschooled our daughter for the past 3 years. This year, she has decided to return to public school.	1.0 That's interesting! Most kids love being home-schooled but I guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers.
0.0 She did miss having a lot of friends. I hope she does well. She starts in 10 days!	1.0 Not too much longer! I hope she adjusts well and enjoys herself. Public school can still provide an enriching experience when it comes to social skills and education.
0.0 This will be my last semester in college! I cant wait to finish.	1.0 Wow good job! SO close
0.0 THanks!. I get so happy everytime I think about it!	1.0 Thats a great accomplishment
0.0 Since I moved to dallas I have not met any friends. I go to work and school and just come home. 	1.0 maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
0.0 I agree. It gets boring at home alone with no one. 	1.0 i agree. you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
0.0 I agree. This weekend it is! 	1.0 that should be fun. good luck!
0.0 My sister lives in Utah. We had planned for her to come visit but her work would not allow her to take the time off.	1.0 Aw that's annoying. Work always gets in the way of things. Did you ever try to go to her?
0.0 I haven't yet. I would like to eventually. I'm hoping to see her soon	1.0 I'm sure it will work out! Not this time unfortunatly, but it will in the end
0.0 So I was out of town this weekend and lent my brother my car. I was hesitant at first, but I felt he would do good with it and take care of it. 	1.0 Did he take care of it for you?
0.0 He did. I feel I can let him use it more often after this. 	1.0 That is great that he was able to show you he is responsible. I bet you're proud. 
0.0 My husband works very hard so that I can be a stay at home mom. It has allowed me the freedom to homeschool our daughter.	1.0 That's awesome, what does your hubster do?
0.0 He owns an auto repair shop. He works from sun up to sun down!	1.0 Wow, I admire his dedication! And you won't ever have to worry about your vehicle breaking!
0.0 So my 1 year review at work is coming up and I feel its going to be good since I wokred so hard. 	1.0 Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature, it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated
0.0 I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for. 	1.0 Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them
0.0 My child sneaked in my room to get the Xbox controller while I was sleeping. The night before, I had grounded her.	1.0 Oh no, do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her?
0.0 I think she thought she could play a few minutes of Minecraft and then return the controller before I woke up! I caught her getting into the drawer where I hid it.	1.0 I definitely remember trying something like that when I was a kid.  I think sometimes kids think they're sneakier than they actually are.
0.0 My friend came to my house drunk and threw up everywhere. 	1.0 Whow!  That sounds really disgusting!  What did you do?
0.0 Yes it was! I could not do nothing. She was in a raging fit. Ijust made she she went to sleep ok. 	1.0 Man, you are a good friend!  I would have been beyond angry!
0.0 My friends mother got diagnosed with cancer last month and its been hard on her. 	1.0 So sorry to hear that. It is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity
0.0 Yeah. Shes my best friend, so I'm planning to go with her this weekend to see her mom. my heart breaks for her..	1.0 Indeed. Friends should be together in times of need. That is what friends are for
0.0 Last week I did a presentation at work and as I stood up I blew some gas!	1.0 oh no!! Did anyone notice? it's normal though, we all do that sometimes
0.0 Yes it was loud. I can feel my face turn red and the room getting quiet!	1.0 oh man... It happened to me before, i know how embarrassing it is.
0.0 So my little brother barely passed his finals to become a cop! I could not beleive it. 	1.0 That's great that he passed though!  ARe you happy about it?
0.0 Im very happy, but all he do through school was party and never study. Im shocked. 	1.0 Well at least he passed - that's great!
0.0 We went to the library where they had an animal expert stop by for the kids. My daughter was able to answer most of his questions that other kids could not. It made me smile.	1.0 That is pretty neat actually. I wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that.
0.0 You should check your local library. The ones in my area have tons of things, like a Lego club, for the local kids.	1.0 I will do that, i had no idea.
0.0 My dad died of cancer in 2012. That was really hard for me emotionally.	1.0 I'm really sorry to hear that.
0.0 Thank you. I was prepared, but it was still difficult.	1.0 I can't even imagine to be honest.
0.0 I hope you don't have to go through it for a long time.	1.0 I have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with.
0.0 It's always tough, even if someone is older.	1.0 I'm sure it will be different when it's a parent.
0.0 I have a performance review and potential promotion coming up in the next few weeks.	1.0 that's awesome! I hope you will get a promotion. what do you do for work?
0.0 I work as an accountant for a carpet cleaning company. There is a chance that I could be made a manager!	1.0 You will be a great manager! Good luck with everythig
0.0 I just hired a new hotel inspector, he has very little experience but wants to learn. Scares me.	1.0 you took a risk huh? i hope he will be a great worker! That's good you gave him a chance
0.0 Yes, I need more staff member and he was very nice. But if he does a bad job I get fired.	1.0 i hope it won't happen! 
0.0 In high school, I fell down the stairs in front of my crush. My face turned red and I ran away!	1.0 Oh no! Did he say anything about it?
0.0 He laughed at me. Looking back, I'm sure it was funny but in the moment, I could have died!	1.0 I know what you mean. I've done stuff like that too - you do feel a bit silly, don't you!
0.0 Last night I won a gift card at Trivia night at the pub. Going shopping today.	1.0 Awesome! What are you planning on buying?
0.0 I've got a baby due in December so something for the baby or my wife. I never bother getting my self anything.	1.0 Maybe you can figure out a way to get all three of you guys something!
0.0 I found out my wife was dating someone else a year before we got married, we were together for 7 years at that point. Today I'm stressed!	1.0 Oh no that is crazy!
0.0 Yea, We have a baby due in December so I'm trying to not jump to any decisions to quickly.	1.0 Well I'm sorry you are going through this and I hope you can figure it all out. 
0.0 I woke up one morning to make a sandwich. The smell of the sandwich meat made me sick! I felt something was wrong and drove to the nearest store. I purchased a pregnancy test.	1.0 I hate those things, i try to not eat those at all.
0.0 I usually love eating sandwiches which is why I knew something just wasn't right! I was experiencing morning sickness!	1.0 I eat steak and shrimp.
0.0 I have a friend that will not stop talking about himself. He always wants to talk about his latest investments, the books he has read, and how much he knows about the places that he visits!	1.0 i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face.
0.0 I do too. It makes me not want to be around those types of people.	1.0 i wouldn't be friends with someone like that. i mean what can you benefit from that friendship?
0.0 Exactly! I should really stop hanging out with him.	1.0 agreed. you really won't be missing out on anything worthwhile.
0.0 I am a big Taylor Swift friend! 	1.0 I love Taylor Swift! She's talented and beautiful!
0.0 Yes I need to arrive at her concert tonight at  8!	1.0 How exciting for you! Have fun!
0.0 I know I studied well, but I can't stop worrying about it. 	1.0 You have a test coming up?
0.0 Yes on Friday. It is the final.	1.0 Well I hope you do well! Good luck.
0.0 She had a lot  of friends that came.	1.0 That's interesting. What was she doing?
0.0 She had her birthday at Chuck E Cheese.	1.0 That's awesome! I didn't know that place was still in business. 
0.0 I love to coupon but sometimes I feel like the cashiers aren't trained properly. They will look at the coupon for every detail and do not understand the language in the fine print.	1.0 Yeah I bet it is frustrating. The store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick.
0.0 I agree. It's not like the money will come out of their paycheck if something is wrong!	1.0 I hope they get better training so you don't have to argue with them about it
0.0 The cop said he was too old!	1.0 Too old for what? What a strange thing to say.
0.0 Too old to give him a ticket for reckless driving! 	1.0 That doesn't make much sense. Maybe I am missing the context.
0.0 I played a game of poker with a friend who had no idea what he was doing. I won about $100 from him that night.	1.0 Oh no, he shouldn't have gambled. 
0.0 You are probably right! I felt bad when I was spending the money. I hope he didn't really need it.	1.0 I would've too, but sometimes people need to learn a lesson.
0.0 Recently there have been a few break ins.	1.0 Oh no! Did you property get broken into? Or your neighbor's property?
0.0 No, my neighbor did but that's close enough for me! 	1.0 For real! Are you taking any precautions?
0.0 One time I saw a stray dog walking around a restaurant looking for food	1.0 Inside the restaurant ? What kind of place was this ?
0.0 It was outside a fried chicken chain restaurant	1.0 Okay, that makes more sense then to me.
0.0 We made sure to board up for the hurricane coming.	1.0 Where are you located ?
0.0 We are in Miami, Florida 1 mile from the beach. .	1.0 I wasn't even aware there was a hurricane.
0.0 The cop said I will probably never find out who did it. 	1.0 Who did what?
0.0 I wont find out who the person was that hit my car while I was sleeping.	1.0 Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. People are so inconsiderate!
0.0 My sons teacher isn't very nice to the young kindergartners. 	1.0 Oh no! Why not?!
0.0 Not, sure, but she is not very nice at all.	1.0 I would make a complaint to the principal if I were you!
0.0 I may never know who she was.	1.0 Never know who was?
0.0 The women that hit my car and left before the police came.	1.0 Wow that is aweful! 
0.0 Near my house, there is an abandoned school that is said to be haunted. When I was a teenager, a group of friends and I decided to go check it out.	1.0 Oh wow, what happened?
0.0 When we pulled up, it was very spooky. I didn't even want to get out of the car! A few of my friends tried to get in but it was boarded up. I looked in the window and there was still writing on the chalkboards!	1.0 That would give me the creeps! Has anyone seen anything there?
0.0 There are stories about ghosts of children walking through the hallways and that you can hear laughing. We didn't see or hear anything supernatural but it was still scary!	1.0 I bet it was. I've only had one creepy experience - that was in an old house in West Virginia. I'm very careful to avoid those places these days!
0.0 My hair has always been long and I had been scared to have a short hair cut. Last December, I finally took the plunge and cut off all of my hair.	1.0 Good for you! There is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair.
0.0 That's what I have discovered! I get a lot of compliments on it and I feel really good about myself when I go out!	1.0 Great! I'm glad that it worked out well for you!
0.0 I recently drove back to my hometown and went to the towns fair, it felt so nice reliving my childhood.	1.0 That's awesome, I went to visit my parents and my hometown last month, it is a great feeling.  How was the fair?
0.0 It was great, it didn't change much but it still has that 'soul' to it. Just felt great looking at it honestly.	1.0 Brings back all the memories you had as a kid.  I miss going to the state fair, was always fun.
0.0 When I was in high school, I dated a guy for almost a year. A few weeks before summer, he broke up with me and started seeing another girl.	1.0 You must have been sad and angry.
0.0 I was. I would get really mad when I saw them at lunch or after school together. I was my first experience with heart break.	1.0 Yes first heart brake is so hard, I feel for you, something similar happened to me with my first boyfriend.
0.0 This was my first time winning a contest on the raido!	1.0 That's awesome! Congratulations!
0.0 Thanks! I will get to go free to the Taylor Swift concert tonight! 	1.0 No way! That's actually a super awesome prize! Have fun
0.0 I bought extra items during school lunch in high school. I have a negative balance on my account.	1.0 Ouch, hopefully its not by much. I remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation. They're usually pretty lenient on it.
0.0 I had to take money out of my dad's wallet to cover it. I would have got in so much trouble with my parents for buying candy! It wasn't much but I still felt bad.	1.0 I'm sure your dad wouldn't mind haha, its usually pretty cheap anything i remember they cost like $1.
0.0 I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.	1.0 Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.
0.0 Yeah we tried but he cut all communication, he didn't respond to his phone number or anything. I hope he got fined a larger amount so it teaches him a lesson on laziness. 	1.0 I do too! People like that make me never want to have a roommate! 
0.0 So i recently traveled to Cuba to see some friends and we went to a bar until 3 AM, and as we were walking back there were these 3 guys hiding in the shadows. We got so scared we started running but thankfully they didn't follow.	1.0 Oh wow. That's pretty scary. I would be horrified.
0.0 Yeah it was quite an experience, my friends said those are usually drunk people who stay up the whole night talking with people. But they looked like they wanted to do more than talk!	1.0 Well, at least they didn't follow you. How is Cuba? My parents are from there but I've never been.
0.0 I raised 6 chickens since they were babies. I was trying to let them free range but I forgot to put them back in their coop for the night. A predator was able to get to them.	1.0 Oh no! That's sad, did he get them all?
0.0 Yes, it did! I think it was a dog that always gets out of our neighbor's yard.	1.0 Aw, that's too bad, hopefully next time they will be safe in the coop!
0.0 I was looking through old clothes that i was giving away and found $40 in one of the back pockets. Made me very happy lol	1.0 wow, so what are you going to do with it?
0.0 Oh i just put it into a little piggy bank i have, trying to get to $220 to cop some yeezys that are coming out in october. Hope i get a pair!	1.0 nice, i hope that works out for you... good luck
0.0 I was watching youtube and saw this guy eat a jellyfish straight out of the ocean. Looked like the most disgusting thing someone could eat.	1.0 That is gross, I can't even imagine what that would taste like!
0.0 He said it had the texture of hard rubber and tasted of pure algae and just dead stuff. He even ate another one that he pan-fried and it was all green and moldy.	1.0 That's so gross, I would take a hard pass on eating that. I like seafood but that's too much.
0.0 One of my friends jumped from the roof of his house to the pool and somehow made it, it was like 10+ feet of distance, really amazing stuff.	1.0 Omg, Thankfully he wasn't hurt. 
0.0 Yeah i was really nervous that he was gonna get hurt since he likes to do stupid dares. It was quite the experience.	1.0 Did yall happen to get it on video? 
0.0 My older brother is getting married Friday.	1.0 Congrats!, I'm sure you must be very happy!
0.0 I am very happy for him! I thought it was never going to happen!	1.0 Haha brotherly love, I hope him and the lucky gal have a wonderful life together!
0.0 Having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person's life. I cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born.	1.0 thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day
0.0 It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.	1.0 i bet so!
0.0 im nervous for the new week to begin	1.0 Is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week?
0.0 very busy and lots of traveling	1.0 That can be stressful. I am sure that every thing with go smoothly for you! Just remember that the weekend is only 5 days away! 
0.0 I spent 10 minutes looking for my car keys while my friends waited outside and they were in my pockets the whole time. My friends made sure i never forgot that moment haha	1.0 We all do stuff like that. At least you didn't lock them inside your car. Done that before!
0.0 Oh thankfully i've never had to go through that yet. That one would really suck!	1.0 Yeah nothing like calling the locksmith and admitting you are not very bright. Haha.
0.0 I told her I had to work because I didn't want to go see a movie tonight.	1.0 Did you not want to go out, or did you just not like the movie?
0.0 I was tired and wanted to get in bed early, 	1.0 Just be careful with that. If you feel tired due to stress, it may be the stress talking and not you.
0.0 Had my finals last week, studied really hard for them. Felt so nice walking into that room so confident and calm	1.0 Great, when will you know your scores?
0.0 Thankfully i knew them right at the spot, i got a 98!	1.0 Wow, that's fantastic.
0.0 He doesn;t seem to see the issue.	1.0 Who doesn't?
0.0 My husband doesn't see flirting with girls a problem. 	1.0 What a jerk! That is definitely a problem!
0.0 I studied all week for my math finals and only scraped a 68 on it.	1.0 That's a real bummer. Do you at least pass the class?
0.0 Yeah, passed with a 75, not what i wanted but at least i passed	1.0 Well at least you don't have to take it again. Could have been worse.
0.0 i dropped my groceries in the parking lot	1.0 Oh no, how awful for you! I hope people helped you to pick them up (and didn't help themselves!).
0.0 i grabbed the cans that rolled away, lol	1.0 Glad you find humor in it! I dropped a bottle of water once, which rolled under the car. I was livid!
0.0 One of my roommates left without cleaning his room and the school charged me and my roommates 100$ each	1.0 That's extremely frustrating! What were they expecting you to do? It's not your fault your roommate left it trashed.
0.0 Yeah thats what we told them but they showed us the paper saying that its one of the rules. We were so furious at that guy, worst thing is he never responded to our calls or texts. Really immature and selfish of him.	1.0 Well, I guess the good news is that he no longer lives with you. But that blows, how hard is it to clean up after yourself before you leave?
0.0 A restaurant that I wanted to eat at had "call ahead seating" where you can call and get placed on a waiting list. I called ahead and was told we would have a table in 10 minutes. When we arrived 10 minutes later, our table was not ready!	1.0 That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.
0.0 That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.	1.0 Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.
0.0 We had a new puppy. He loved to chew on everything. I went to the grocery store and when I got back home, the puppy had pulled the cushions off of the couch. He had chewed through the bottom!!	1.0 Oh god! I haven't had a puppy in a long time, but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy-proof. They find ways to make messes in the most creative ways.
0.0 They do! I'm really glad that that stage didn't last too long in him. I just hated having to buy an entire new living room suite! Puppies are expensive.	1.0 Yeah, that's a real headache. I'd want to say they're worth it, but on that day I wouldn't be so sure, haha.
0.0 I accidentally dropped my phone at the screen started to glitch out and didn't want to turn on anymore. I was scared because it was a brand new phone. Thankfully after a while of it just sitting there it turned back on normally.	1.0 That is a huge blessing, I don't know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone.
0.0 Same here, they're so incredibly important in this day and age.	1.0 It's almost a shame how much we depend on them, but I know I'd be lost without mine.
0.0 i am bothered by my neighbors loud power tools next door	1.0 Do they run them all day long - or at night?
0.0 during the morning and day on the weekends!	1.0 Is there any kind of noise ordinance in your area?  I know in ours unless they are still running them at 11pm, there is nothing the police will/can do about it unfortunately - but I can imagine how annoying it is.
0.0 My best friends invited me to a camping trip but I was a little anxious about the whole thing.	1.0 I don't blame  you because I hate camping.
0.0 Really? I was just really scared of getting bitten by a tick. I ended up enjoying the trip in the end!	1.0 Oh I hate ticks and all the bugs.
0.0 i was blown away by how great my friends were this weekend	1.0 What happened?
0.0 they were very supportive and kind , helping me with some moving things	1.0 You are lucky to have such great friends!
0.0 A few weeks ago I was drinking with some friends at a park and I sliced my hand open while trying to rip a beer can in two.	1.0 oh that sucks, i hope it has healed since then
0.0 It has! The cut was so deep and I was bleeding so much I was scared of passing out from blood loss.	1.0 ouch, that sounds awful
0.0 i was shocked how nice the weather was this morning	1.0 How come? Have you had awful weather lately?
0.0 not really but it was just especially nice this morning	1.0 Oh I see. Beautiful weather is an excellent start to the day!
0.0 I decided to move to be with my boyfriend.	1.0 Oh? Big decision. I hope you feel good about it!
0.0 I did, but I had to leave all my family behind	1.0 Aw, but they'll always be there for you when you visit. You have to do what you want to in life, after all
0.0 im mad at my neighbor today	1.0 Oh that sucks! What did your neighbor do to get you angry?
0.0 he was using powertools loud in the morning	1.0 How inconsiderate. People should have more common sense than your neighbor.
0.0 Last Christmas, I saved up a lot of money and was able to buy my family and girlfriend really nice gifts.	1.0 thats awesome, i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them
0.0 Me too! The act of giving makes me feel so warm and happy.	1.0 me too!
0.0 The teacher I had for Calculus 2 last semester was so terrible at his job, I had to learn it all on my own.	1.0 I hate when I get teachers that are clueless. Makes you wonder how they got the job.
0.0 Same here. Surprisingly, I was able to pass the course and I felt so good about myself!	1.0 Well done. You should feel proud for teaching yourself.
0.0 i felt happy this morning because it was sunny and warm	1.0 That's always a great start to a day.
0.0 absolutely, i was overjoyed	1.0 How are you celebrating it?
0.0 I have a big exam coming up tomorrow.	1.0 Oh wow. What's the exam on?
0.0 It's on PC Architecture. I'm feeling pretty good about it though. I studied really hard all week.	1.0 That's really great. I am sure you will do well on the test.
0.0 On my way back from a funeral, my friends and I almost got into a deadly car crash.	1.0 Oh no, what happened?
0.0 I think the other driver was falling asleep on the road. Out of nowhere, he moved onto the wrong lane directly towards us.	1.0 Well that is really lucky you were able to avoid that. Hopefully he didn't hurt anyone else.
0.0 I was so happy that after many years in retail I found a better job.	1.0 Congratulations! Retail really does suck.
0.0 Yeah it does. It really made me dislike people a lot.	1.0 Understandably. My girlfriend is a student and works in retail part-time. She says the same thing.
0.0 Do you ever hear an album and it brings you back to when you first listened to it?	1.0 Oh, all the time. What album is that for you?
0.0 I just listened to a Billy Talent album again the other day and it brought me back to high school and reminded me of the person who showed me them.	1.0 I really love that album! We will have to listen to it together sometime.
0.0 A while back, my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.	1.0 That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?
0.0 No idea. All I know is that I was furious, especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.	1.0 I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.
0.0 Last night was quite a bummer.	1.0 I am sorry to hear that. Why was it a bummer?
0.0 I was planning on going to a concert but ended up not going at the last minute because I didn't want to go by myself. I feel like I'm going to regret not going.	1.0 That really stinks. I bet you felt really lonely and filled my regret.
0.0 After working for a week straight and running a lot of errands, today is my first day off in a while.	1.0 That must feel very refreshing. Would you say you feel content?
0.0 It is, I'm super happy. Currently playing some Zelda on the Switch, it couldn't get any better than this!	1.0 Nice! I want to get that game next week. Looks really cool.
0.0 My older brother always makes promises he can't keep.	1.0 That is disappointing. I wonder why he's like that.
0.0 I don't know why. Recently we were supposed to go out for sushi lunch together, but he keeps postponing it. I'll ask him for a definitive day.	1.0 I hope he doesn't let you down.
0.0 I'm so happy for my brother!	1.0 Something good happen to him recently?
0.0 He just graduated from college. He put in so much work.	1.0 That's amazing! Tell him congratulations from a friendly stranger.
0.0 My little brother failed his French class and had to spend three weeks in summer school.	1.0 Oh no, that's not good! He's not the only one that's not great at French. Most of my family spoke French as a second language when I was growing up and I still never picked it up!
0.0 French is a really hard language, I have trouble too so it really hurt my heart seeing him go to school while all his friends and siblings were having fun without him.	1.0 Hopefully he'll get to enjoy his next summer.
0.0 My boyfriend's brothers got into a fist fight one night and he jumped in the middle.	1.0 That sucks. Did anyone get hurt?
0.0 Some things got broke and there were some bruises, but it was really scary to watch that.	1.0 I bet. I would've hid under the table.
0.0 i am blessed to have a great family	1.0 That's nice. Why do you say that?
0.0 they're just the best and always very helpful	1.0 That's great to hear. I wish I had a helpful family.
0.0 Whenever my sister in law plans things, she only does it around her schedule.	1.0 That's really selfish. Have you talked to her about it?
0.0 Yeah, but she says she tries her best and thinks she is doing what is best for everyone. However, we are the only ones with kids on a schedule.	1.0 Well, at least that's the case. People can only do so much.
0.0 This weekend was kind of a drag.	1.0 Oh yeah? Why is that?
0.0 I couldn't find anyone that wanted to hangout so I had to spend the whole weekend by myself.	1.0 Well sometimes that isn't a bad thing really. You didn't enjoy it at all?
0.0 The vacations I used to take when I was younger with my family have been on mind lately.	1.0 Are the good memories at least?
0.0 Oh yeah, but it really makes me miss those times.	1.0 At least you have those memories. You should go on a vacation soon!
0.0 I'm looking forward to this new game.	1.0 Which one?
0.0 The new Spyro Remastered. It really makes feel think back to when I used to play the original with an old friend of mine. 	1.0 I've actually haven't played that series. When does it come out?
0.0 I told my sister in law that I would help her with her books. After this last one, I felt bad because I told her I couldn't anymore.	1.0 That's rough. Why can't you help her?
0.0 I just have too much going on now with two kids, and working from home.	1.0 Yeah, I am in the same boat. It's a hard knock life out there.
0.0 I saw some person eat like 30 hamburgers in Mcdonalds	1.0 How long did it take them?
0.0 I think he was making a Youtube video so he was eating very fast, so like 10 minutes	1.0 He must of been sick after.
0.0 One time I bought emergency supplies before a hurricane	1.0 That was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
0.0 Yup, people started charging like $5 per bottle of water	1.0 Wow, thats insane.  I feel like thats illegal
0.0 I just got some frustrating news the other day.	1.0 What was the news?
0.0 My son got caught cheating on a test. I really thought we raised him better than to do such things but here we are.	1.0 Are you going to ground him?
0.0 My sister in law and her fiance are always taking trips abroad and we hardly ever go anywhere.	1.0 Why don't you join them?
0.0 We definitely don't have money for that, plus there are four of us.	1.0 Why don't you get another job?
0.0 Ugh. I got some awful news the other day.	1.0 That's too bad. What happened? Is everyone OK?
0.0 I got news that my grandfather passed away. He was old but no one saw it coming. 	1.0 Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I hoep your family is strong enough to support you through this.
0.0 Hi there was a time that I was scared out of my mind I came home and my front door was unlocked and the lights were on in the house	1.0 Holy cow.  Was anything missing?
0.0 no and that was the weird thing nothing was taken	1.0 Had they gone through anything?
0.0 We recently celebrated my son's birthday, and had a big party.	1.0 oh yeah that must have been a good time
0.0 It was! He got a lot of cool toys, and ate a bunch of ice cream.	1.0 Those are the best times when they still like to play with toy's mine lost interest years ago and I miss it
0.0 Next month my wife and I will take our first vacation since we got married.	1.0 that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation, where do you have planned to go?
0.0 We are going to Hawaii for a whole week. We have saved a long time to be able to afford this, I can barely wait till next month.	1.0 That sounds like you guys will spend a lovely time over there good luck
0.0 Do you feel when you see your mom after a long time	1.0 I miss her. You haven't seen your mom in a long time?
0.0 Why! what is the reason	1.0 I'm sorry, but I can't understand what you're saying.
0.0 Last year, during the spring, extremely heavy rainfall caused our basement to become flooded.	1.0 Oh man! I have been there, I hope you didn't have anything special down there??
0.0 I lost all of my childhood photos and many of my childhood toys and things I had saved, my bible from my late grandmother being one of the items.	1.0 Oh lord, i am so sorry! I have been there, that is hard!
0.0 Last week, my coworkers all got together and threw me at party for my 20th anniversary at work.	1.0 taht sounds like fun, i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah. did you enjoy the party?
0.0 Yes, it was great. I had no idea it was even happening, they are so sneaky.	1.0 ahahaah seems to be they really like you working threre
0.0 I took my dog to the vet yesterday... it turns out that he's really sick.	1.0 Aww, I'm sorry.  Is he going to be ok?
0.0 It's not looking too good. I really hope he pulls through.	1.0 I do too.  That's one of the saddest things.  I hope you'll be OK too.
0.0 I was working on a project in this past week, couldn't find it locally, so ended up ordering it online.	1.0 wow nice
0.0 Not really, it still hasn't shown up!  I'm pretty annoyed!	1.0 ooops sorry to hear that
0.0 I saw a deer get hit by a car yesterday.	1.0 oh that sucks.. did someone move it out of the way?
0.0 It wasn't dead, It was injured and moved to the brush on the side of the road. it was upsetting.	1.0 yea you never like to see stuff like that.
0.0 I opened up my mailbox this morning and there was a 10 dollar bill just sitting there inside!	1.0 did you try to find its owner?
0.0 I asked my neighbors about it, no one knew anything about it. I guess it was left there intentionally.	1.0 well that was nice of someone
0.0 A co-worker I've been working on a project with has been late	1.0 That's annoying, are you going to talk to them about it?
0.0 I plan on doing that, it's pretty disruptive	1.0 I hope it all works out in the end.
0.0 I just finished a major project at work for a client	1.0 Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?
0.0 Not at the moment, but I'm praying my supervisor and client likes it	1.0 I hope so too! Projects can be stressful!
0.0 I have an appointment for tomorrow. I'm hoping the same thing.	1.0 What is the appointment for?
0.0 My cat hasn't been feeling well this past week, I think there might be something really wrong.	1.0 Let's hope not! My prayers are with her.
0.0 Thank you. I hope it's something that he will get over soon.	1.0 You're welcome. It's always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that.
0.0 5	1.0 I think there might be something wrong with the platform at the moment.
0.0 My child needs to start going to bed early to prep for school. Last night, I caught her sneaking her phone and watching tv at 12am.	1.0 Oh man, sounds like most kids. She's gonna hate it at first, but getting to bed early will help with her future.
0.0 I've tried to explain that to her. It's like it goes in one ear and out the other. It bugs me.	1.0 Well yea, they're young right now and can't see the consequences yet.
0.0 A group of coworkers who play the same lottery numbers every week won $100, 000 on the pick 6 last week.	1.0 that is so lucky, they must be so happy they bought that ticket
0.0 They had asked me if I wanted to go in with them, and I said no. I regret that now, I could have really used a share of that money.	1.0 i know that is such a bomber you must have been so angry hahaha
0.0 I studied really had so I am sure I will pass my test!	1.0 What kind of test is it
0.0 It was my science final for college. 	1.0 Oh I hope you do well then
0.0 My friend went on a 14 day cruise to Europe. I wish that could have been me! 	1.0 wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long
0.0 Right? Talk about ultimate relaxation!	1.0 yea i wonder how much something like that costs .. i guess if you have to ask you cant afford it as they say
0.0 My son is supposed to be sending me some money...	1.0 that is really nice of him, how much time will you have to wait?
0.0 Hopefully not too much longer. I've been waiting for a few days now.	1.0 well i hope everything goes well at the bank and with the transaction
0.0 I am scared of another hurricane coming through Florida. I had a bad experience last year.	1.0 that is horrible, natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them
0.0 No, all you can do is try to prepare. Do you live anywhere where there is threat of natural disasters? 	1.0 not really, the worst thing that can happen where i live is a thunderstorm
0.0 When my son was born it felt like I had everything I needed in life.	1.0 I bet that was a wonderful day
0.0 It really was, my life finally felt complete.	1.0 I am very happy for you
0.0 I got passed over for a promotion at work last week, even thought I had more experience than the other applicants.	1.0 that is not good, have you expressed your feelings to your boss?
0.0 I did, and it looks like I may be looking for a new job soon as they want to take the company in a new direction.	1.0 well i hope everything goes well for you, you will sure find something fitting for you dont worry
0.0 I remember when I started my first office job out of college. I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect.	1.0 It's a whole new world when that happens, I can totally understand. How'd you cope with it?
0.0 I just tried to keep an open mind and go with the flow. It was hard to get used to sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day, but I soon got used to it.	1.0 It's always best to just open your mind to anything that could happen. It's the best way to learn.
0.0 I found some mold growing out in the garage	1.0 Oh no, that's bad.   Have you had someone come out and check the hose?
0.0 I ended up cleaning it myself, I think I got most of it out	1.0 May be worth letting your insruance comapny know. Usually they have clauses that you have to tell them as soon as you see it otherwise they won't cover any of it.
0.0 I was thinking about when we finally got to go pick up Rodimus after all that waiting!  I've never been so excited in my life.  	1.0 what is that?
0.0 It's our Rotty pup! Sorry haha	1.0 oh that explains it!
0.0 I saw a child ask for a candy bar that the grocery store yesterday. The mother spanked the child in front over every one in the line!	1.0 Wow when the child just asked?!
0.0 Yes! It was awful! Luckily the man behind her spoke up. I could tell she was embarrassed but I was furious at her!	1.0 I'm only afraid that the mom is going to let out that embarassment on her child once they get home.
0.0 One time I saw someone's dog pooping in my lawn and they didn't pick it up!	1.0 OMG that's so gross! 
0.0 Yes, I wanted to throw it back at them!	1.0 That would be a memorable lesson to learn. The best lessons are learned that hard way, after all. 
0.0 I used the bathroom at Walmart the other day. I walked around the store for about 30 minutes before I realized I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe!!!	1.0 Oh god. That's kinda gross.
0.0 I felt gross hahaha I kicked it off of my shoe and stuffed it under a rack. I hope know one saw.	1.0 Rest in peace whoever touches that rack.
0.0 My son just started a new school.  The communication with them has been terrible!	1.0 Oh dear. How do they let the parents know what's going on?
0.0 I sometimes find out but it seems so disorganized!	1.0 That sounds really frustrating. I'm sorry that's happening!
0.0 We went to the lagoon a few weeks ago. My friends dared me to jump off of the highest cliff into the water.	1.0 Oh wow.  Terrifying.  All I think of is Johnny Erricson Tada, who broke her neck in that situation. Did you do it?
0.0 That was what I was worried about! I ended up not jumping off of the highest one. I was too scared. I did jump off of the smallest one. That was really fun!	1.0 You did the right thing!  Oh fun!  I'm glad you were safe and had a blast! 
0.0 I have a test coming up in one of my classes this week.	1.0 Do you feel ready for it?
0.0 Oh yeah, I'm definitely ready. I know I'm going to pass.	1.0 Awesome, hope it goes as planned!
0.0 I had about 6 or 7 hummingbirds in my yard the other day feeding.	1.0 Oh how exciting! Did you take any pictures?
0.0 No. my camera isn't good enough to get good pictures, they are so small.	1.0 Awww...that's a bit disappointing, but really cool that you got to see them!
0.0 I was trying to buy a piece of property that came up on the market, but someone put in a bid before I got a chance and it has already sold.	1.0 The market can be competitive if the price is right. They'll sell immediatley.
0.0 It is a piece of property that my grandfather owned and I pretty much grew up on, I would have really liked to have owned it.	1.0 That would have been awesome if you got it.
0.0 I worked for weeks on a presentation for work. I practiced over and over. I felt relaxed the morning of.	1.0 That's good! That probably means you worked on it until it became something you're proud of.
0.0 You are right! I was really proud of it! I'm glad I worked so hard on it. It lessened the anxiety that I usually have!	1.0 Maybe I could learn from that. I get really nervous when I have to do any public speaking, so maybe if I just prepared for it better it would help.
0.0 I was under the impression that my friends would pay me back.	1.0 What did they do to you?
0.0 They owed me money but never paid me back. I suppose it's not a huge deal though.	1.0 It happens sometimes. you may ask them directly to pay back.
0.0 I worked with daughter for months with learning her multiplication tables. We've practiced and practiced and she still doesn't know them all!	1.0 I totally get that.  I'm in the same place with my daughter.  I home school and she's learning them too. Give it time and she'll get it soon.  Its so much to memorize at once! 
0.0 We homeschool too! I hope she can get them soon! It will make this year's math so much easier!	1.0 That's awesome!  She will!  The best thing about homeschooling is that they can learn more at their own pace.  I'm not looking forward to division! ha ha
0.0 I'm going on a hiking trip soon	1.0 Do you hike very often?
0.0 Here and there when I have time	1.0 I've never been hiking, really! I'd like to go some day.
0.0 I scrapbook pictures of my son and I am a few years behind!	1.0 Oh, such fun!  Do you have all the Stamp It Up scrapbooking things I hear so much about? I bet it can be hard to keep it updated! They grow so fast!
0.0 My son just started school all day, so I plan to start scrapbooking.  I don't use Stamp It Up though.	1.0 Perfect!  Now you'll be caught up in no time.  I know you'll be so gratified to finish and be able to look at all of them when he's much older.
0.0 This past weekend, my cat Sam passed away, he was 17 years old.	1.0 So sorry to hear of Sam's passing.
0.0 Yeah, it's been really strange the past few days without him asleep on my feet while I work.	1.0 May your many memories of Sam help you to sustain at this difficult time.
0.0 I have nothing to complain about. Life is good.	1.0 That is awesome.  I'm with you on that.  Tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great.  I don't like to take it for granted.
0.0 No point in being a pessimist.	1.0 Exactly! You'll go far with that attitude!  
0.0 I baked a cake for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out to be so delicious! He was so excited. 	1.0 Mmm, now you're making me hungry for cake. What kind of cake was it?
0.0 Black forest cake! It happens to be both our favorite kind of cake. I made it from scratch. What's your favorite cake? 	1.0 Personally I'm a huge fan of red velvet, but black forest is amazing too!
0.0 I felt so bad when I had to board my dog while I was on vacation. It made me feel like a bad dog mom! 	1.0 Aww, I know that can be hard, but you can't be too hard on yourself.  Sometimes you don't have a choice.
0.0 I know. She was so excited when we came home though which made us feel a bit better. 	1.0 Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
0.0 I'm happy with the person that I grew up to be.	1.0 What are some of your best traits?
0.0 I'm healthy!	1.0 Do you exercise often?
0.0 So we finally found the perfect Rotty breeder and we got to pick up our puppy this week!	1.0 Oh boy that is great news! I hope you didn't drop a pretty penny on it! Haha, and even if you did, dogs are worth it.
0.0 No he was the runt so we got him on the cheap side!  He is sooooo sweet!  I am so happy	1.0 Hey runts are the best! They need love too. Either way, I'm glad you were paired up with the perfect companion.
0.0 I love going to Disney World. It makes me remember all the wonderful memories I made there as a child.	1.0 I've never been, but it looks like so much fun.
0.0 It is a great place for both kids and adults! I don't have any kids yet, but can't wait to bring mine when I have them someday. 	1.0 It would be so much fun to go there as a family.
0.0 Sometimes when I am out in public, my son throws a tantrum.	1.0 Oh yeah I am right there with you, I just don't even go out anymore if I can help it! How old is yours? Mines 2 1/2
0.0 Mine is 5.  Every now and then, he says a curse word, uses it properly too!	1.0 They are too smart for their own good
0.0 I was just about to make a sandwich to eat, when I discovered something really gross.	1.0 what did you see? please don't tell me there was a bug in your bread
0.0 No, there weren't any bugs. But there was mold.	1.0 ewwww, so nasty! i almost ate a molded avocado today. good thing i noticed before scooping it
0.0 The head of marketing at my job recently dumped a bunch of new tasks on me and my coworker. I feel like she's just lazy and making us do her job.	1.0 or maybe she just knows you're a great worker and very responsible? I hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks
0.0 Ha, that's a really nice way of looking at it but nah I'm pretty sure it's mostly laziness.	1.0 did you try talking to her about it? Just be straight forward and tell you how you feel
0.0 I can't believe this!  Some kid at the gas station nearly hit me and then had the nerve to call me awful names!	1.0 Did you call the police?
0.0 No!  I got so flustered and kind of paniked.  	1.0 Its horrible to have to got through things like thaty
0.0 Guess what!  I nailed my review for this year and got a raise!	1.0 That's great! I'm so happy for you!
0.0 Thank you! I worked so hard and I am so freaking excited!  I am also up for a promotion if we keep growing!	1.0 Ooh, will you be managing anyone?
0.0 I freaking dropped my coffee on the ground this morning	1.0 I hear you! I drop things all the time. Was it one you just bought?
0.0 Yes.  And to make it even worse I soaked myself!	1.0 Ugh! Were you away from home?
0.0 My stepdaughter graduated from college in May and got a job in San Francisco making 3 times more than I have ever made.	1.0 Oh wow, she's doing great. I know it probably feels a bit bad that she's making so much more than you, but hopefully you can find  away to be proud of her.
0.0 I'm definitely proud! It doesn't feel bad at all. I'm so happy about how much drive she has to succeed.	1.0 Oh well that's great! Some people would get a little jealous. I'm glad you're proud of her, I'm sure she worked very hard for her success!
0.0 Whew. I finally got all of my work done for the day.	1.0 That is a good feeling!
0.0 It really is! Now I can go home and just relax for the rest of the evening.	1.0 Nice! No kids at home?
0.0 I am so nervous.  I have to go to the dentist tomorrow to get a filling replaced. 	1.0 Are you afraid of the dentist?
0.0 I am!  I had a bad experience with one when I was younger.	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that, I'm pretty terrified of the dentist myself. Ask for gas! Good luck, I'm sure everything will be just fine.
0.0 I spoke at a conference recently. I was a little scared going into it but felt great as I knew I knew my speech.	1.0 Oh nice! That's super brave of you.
0.0 I'm actually one of those fortunate people who doesn't have a fear of public speaking. 	1.0 That's a great skill to have!
0.0 I was cleaning out my attic and found a box full of old photo albums. I spent the next few hours looking at old photos and having a great time.	1.0 That must have been a nice feeling. 
0.0 It really was. I miss a lot of the people in the photos, made me really smile to see their faces again.	1.0 I love that nostalgic feeling. 
0.0 I am so irritated.  My dog keeps trying to eat up my shoes no matter where I put them!	1.0 Haha, sounds like my pupper, is she still young?
0.0 Yeah she's only about six months.  Despite all her chew toys its still my shoes she craves...	1.0 Right!? It's weird, you buy them all the toys in the world, but they still go after your stuff.
0.0 My husband works late at night and sometimes I'm stuck by myself.	1.0 Why he is working late?
0.0 He owns his own business working on cars. If something goes wrong, he is forced to stay to fix the issue.	1.0 I understand. Could you plan to do something when he is late (going out with friends)?
0.0 My aunt just signed for my cousin to get an FJ Cruiser! That is my dream car! He doesn't even have a job.	1.0 Aww man that sucks for you 
0.0 It does! Maybe he will at least let me drive it!	1.0 Hopefully! It is your dream car after all
0.0 I'm looking forward to visiting a friend over the weekend	1.0 That should be fun. Any big planes?
0.0 Nothing too big, probably just wander around town	1.0 That will be nice to catch up.
0.0 I'm so irritated at my neighbor. She moved out recently and left ALL her garbage and old furniture in our parking lot by the garbage.	1.0 That's not very considerate of her. Was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too? Some people!
0.0 Not at all, that's what is so weird! She was really polite, quiet, and neat.	1.0 I wonder what could have changed? Either way, I'd be pretty pissed off.
0.0 Last week the plant I work at was hit with massive layoffs. 	1.0 Oh no! That is terrible!
0.0 I was fortunate enough to be one of the very few who got to keep their job, I am happy but very sad for the others.	1.0 I understand. Layoffs are hard. My brother in law has been through a lot of those at factories!
0.0 Two years ago my wife and I got divorced. It has been very odd in this big house all by myself.	1.0 How do you feel these days?
0.0 It has gotten a little better with time, but still a pretty sore spot for me.	1.0 It must be difficult, do you think she will come back ever?
0.0 I lost my job earlier this year. I was really worried about how to pay my bills and finding a new job.	1.0 Ouch! That's rather painful. What are you doing now?
0.0 Well that's the cool thing... the week my unemployment ran out I got a job offer. At my former company, no less. So everything worked out!	1.0 Wow! That's like a paid vacation!
0.0 Last week a friend of mine won $2000 on a scratch off ticket. I buy those things all the time and never win squat.	1.0 Wow, that's incredible. What's their secret? 
0.0 Right place, right time I guess. Some people are just lucky.	1.0 Congrats to your friend. I hope they share!
0.0 My niece got sent home from school yesterday with that stomach bug that's going around	1.0 That's unfortunate, hope you don't get it as well!
0.0 I know!  I've been pretty worried about her.  She's such a tiny thing.	1.0 I'm sure she will be fine with some rest and a little bit of time. 
0.0 My phone went missing. Imagine my surprise when I got a Facebook message "from myself, " it was the person who found it saying "I have your phone."	1.0 Wow... that's kind of creepy actually. Were you able to get it back?
0.0 I was! The guy was really nice and refused the cash I tried to give him as a reward.	1.0 You're very lucky he was nice and didn't steal any of your data.
0.0 I just got some new neighbors. I'm kinda nosy so I asked if I could take a look at how they decorated, just out of curiosity.	1.0 Did you bring them a pan of ludefisk first? What did they say?
0.0 Nah, although I did consider brownies. They were happy to meet me so it was all good. But man I couldn't believe how nice their place looked compared to mine! I am a little jealous of their interior decorating skills.	1.0 Next time they let you in, just steal all your favorite pieces of decor and replace them with brownies.
0.0 My kid was signing The Spice Girls a few years ago. She thought she had discovered a new band! She asked if I had ever heard of them before.	1.0 Yeah, they are cute like that. How old is she ?
0.0 She almost 11 now. She loves to listen to all of the bands from when I was younger. It's really cute.	1.0 I have a 10 year old like that.
0.0 My daughter practiced her gymnastics every day all summer. We just found out that she made the team!	1.0 that's amazing. watching your children succeed is so rewarding
0.0 It is! I cannot wait to see what's in store for her future! Maybe a scholarship!	1.0 that is awesome. i hope she has very much success in her gymnastic endevours.
0.0 thank you!	1.0 you are very welcome. good luck!
0.0 My grandma threw away my high school yearbooks.	1.0 That's awful! I hope that she didn't mean too!
0.0 I don't think she realized what they were. I was pretty irritated as they can't be replaced but what can you do?	1.0 Yeah, It really sounds like she didn't mean to. Sometimes you can find copies online if you look. 
0.0 We've had our dog for over 8 years. He past away this spring.	1.0 I'm so so sorry!  We lost our chihuahua in February, so I completely understand that feeling.  Was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden?
0.0 It was sudden. He was completely fine when we went to bed. No issues at all. Its been hard for our daughter	1.0 I think it might actually be harder to watch our kids go through that kind of loss than to actually go through it ourselves.  Our pup was our daughter's dog and she was sick prior to passing, so we knew it was coming.  Still doesn't really help though.  We ended up adopting a pup from the shelter that had lost her human mom - it was meant to me - my daughter lost her pup and this pup had lost her mom.  It's helped, something to think about at least.
0.0 I bought my daughter her first cell phone. It's a lot of responsibility for her. I hope she is ready for it.	1.0 I am sure she will be smart with it
0.0 I hope so. She has done well with tablets so I'm hoping she'll do the same with a phone	1.0 You can always show her the ways
0.0 I accidentally knocked over a little kid coming out of the store the other day.	1.0 Were they okay?
0.0 Yeah thankfully he was totally fine. But I felt so bad.	1.0 At least you're not getting sued
0.0 Oh man, that would be terrible. Way to look on the bright side!	1.0 Im good at that lol
0.0 I'm going skydiving this weekend. My stomach all ready hurts with fear.	1.0 Don't worry you'll be fine.  It's safe.
0.0 This is my 3rd time and I'm still scared	1.0 I'm surprised you haven't started to relax a little yet.
0.0 We moved into a 200 year old house. There are creeks and cracks that creep me out!	1.0 I can only imagine. At least its nice in the day time though?
0.0 Sometimes. I try to avoid that attic during any time of the day! There's also a weird door about knee-height. When you open it up, it's just big enough to fit a storage tub.	1.0 I am not sure I would do well in that house
0.0 After my mom passed away I found all our old cassette tapes in her storage, listening to those was pretty cool.	1.0 Bet that brought back good memories.
0.0 Definitely, brought me right back to the road trips we took when I was younger.	1.0 Where did you guys usually go?
0.0 I've spent all day getting my kit ready for the next competition this weekend. I'm exhausted.	1.0 whats the competition on ?
0.0 Highland games. I throw the caber and heavy hammer.	1.0 Nice hope you win , ill be looking into this further 
0.0 I'm so angry at my self. I was in my performance review today and I passed wind in front of my boss. OMG 	1.0 I wonder how that was noted on your report.
0.0 I got a raise so not that bad but it was still off putting. I've heard her rip one in the past so I guess no judgement. 	1.0 Sounds like a wacky place to work.
0.0 I got a raise today. I've pushed my self hard this last year and I deserve it.	1.0 That is awesome. Congratulations. Im sure you earned every penny.
0.0 Thanks it's been a rough year. My hours were cut but I was expected to keep up the same work load. Thanks again!	1.0 Good things happen to people who put in the effort. It sounds well deserved.
0.0 For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.	1.0 Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?
0.0 I don't think so, it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.	1.0 I hope it's not a crazy person or worse, an alien waiting to abduct you!
0.0 I told my daughter she wasn't allowed to watch Youtube because it's hard to monitor. I caught her sneaking and watching videos last night!	1.0 Its so hard to monitor that stuff now
0.0 It is! There's also a ton of weird stuff on there that's labeled for kids.	1.0 Yeah, that is a scary thing to think about too
0.0 I walk my dog for 30 minutes at a time but no matter what, he always ends up using the bathroom inside! I wish he would left me know if he needs to go out.	1.0 On no!  That is no good!  Is he still a puppy?
0.0 No! He's about 2 years old now. Sometimes I think he does it out a spite when he's not getting enough attention!	1.0 Hopefully he is not doing it out of spite!  Maybe you should hire a dog trainer to see if they can correct his behavior.
0.0 My neighbor stole a package from me.	1.0 No way? Do you have proof? That is terrible.
0.0 So check this out, I ordered a planter for my porch. That's how I know he did it, the exact planter I ordered and never got appeared on HIS porch a few days after my package went missing!	1.0 Wow. That is horrible. I would get a camera and try to film them in the act and go to the police. I would be so angry.
0.0 I moved to northern Alaska last year and don't know anyone. 	1.0 you havent met all three people in the city yet?
0.0 haha. I live about 1 hour south of Barrow the most northern place in the USA and about 12 hours north of any actual city. 	1.0 ah well it sounds like i hit the nail on the head
0.0 My coworker was able to find a new job after only looking for like a week.	1.0 What kind of job was it
0.0 Sales, so I'm not really envious about that part as I'm not into sales but I was still upset that he found a job so easily and I couldn't. We both wanted out of that company so bad.	1.0 Sales do sound hard to do
0.0 My cat got sick the other day, he was really pathetic. I felt so bad for him.	1.0 Is he going to be okay
0.0 Yes, thankfully! The vet gave him some fluids and I made sure he got some food in him. He's doing much better today.	1.0 I am glad then, I hate to see pets in pain
0.0 My friend is a single mom who works full time. She just graduated college!	1.0 That is quite an accomplishment.  Someone like that is really inspiring.
0.0 Right? I'm so proud of her. Her accomplishment really made me think about just how lazy I am in my own life haha	1.0 Hahahaha, it's hard to compare yourself with that, but it really let's you know what's possible if you really want something.
0.0 I think I got my coworker in trouble.	1.0 Why? Were they not working?
0.0 He called in sick, but spent the day at the waterpark with his kids. I didn't realize he'd called in sick, I thought he was just out. So, I accidentally told my boss where he was.	1.0 He should have been honest from the start. It's on him not you.
0.0 Thanks, that's a good point. Or at least let me know he's going to lie so I can cover for him!	1.0 Do you think your boss will tell him it's you that told on him?
0.0 Saturday I'm climbing Mt. Elbert the highest Mountain in the lower 48. The nerves has started to set in.	1.0 That's so cool! Do you do a lot of climbing?
0.0 Not so much any more that I moved to the east coast. I do more surfing now but I was able to get off work so I fly into Colorado Thursday.	1.0 Wow, so a proper adventure then. Have fun and stay safe!
0.0 Drove past the area my Middle school was in today. It was gone. I hated it when I was in school but now that's it gone I'm sad	1.0 yea funny how that happens
0.0 It was not even that long ago I went to that school. It's been less then 10 years. They did not even build anything. It's a park now.	1.0 well at least its being put to good use
0.0 I'm going to job interview Thursday. I'm currently employed but I'm ready to move on.	1.0 Hey congrats!  Is it in the same field?
0.0 Yes, I'm currently in middle management this would be the next step up. I'm excited and nervous 	1.0 Heyyy! That's awesome!  I wish you luck! Will it come with a sweet raise too?
0.0 My cousin passed the CPA exam!	1.0 Congratulation. What is he planning to do next?
0.0 She's already working at a Big 4 firm so she's just going to stick with that for a few years. I'm proud of her, it wasn't easy!	1.0 Good. I hope it will help her in career growth.
0.0 I just got a new manager at work. She is really young but seems to be full of good ideals.	1.0 That's cool!  Maybe you'll get along great!
0.0 I plan to steer clear. I'm going to relocate in January so I just need to lay low. I hope she does a great job.	1.0 lol why do you have to steer clear?
0.0 I'm not looking to make a good or bad impression. I just want to do my job and go home. 	1.0 ahhh.  I got you!  Well good luck on the relocation!
0.0 The other weekend I really wanted to go out, but I realized I don't have any good friends left.	1.0 That is a bad realization to come to.  Where did they all go?
0.0 Well I used to hang out with a lot of my coworkers but I left that job. And just kind of drifted away from everyone else. I definitely need to find a new sport or something and make new friends.	1.0 Yeah, that is tough.  Once you get to a certain age you have to work pretty hard to meet people.  Maybe you could join a softball league, that's what I did.
0.0 The other day I was short on cash I needed to pay my phone bill. 	1.0 It can be hard these days, money is tight
0.0 So true. I lucked out though and found a $20 bill on the ground! I hope the person who lost it didn't need it really bad because it definitely helped me out.	1.0 I bet that was a nice surprise
0.0 I lost my credit card this weekend and then in the worst place Walmart.	1.0 Did you get it all straightened out?
0.0 Yes I was very stun someone did a good deed and turned it in with my wallet and all the money in it I was very grateful. 	1.0 Wow that is awesome, too rare in these times, count your lucky stars!
0.0 My oldest daughter started elementary school today I was so glad she had a great first day.	1.0 Oh wonderful!  I'm glad it went so well!  Did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her?
0.0 A new school that's why I was kind of nervous and scared but she loved it.	1.0 Oh boy, I bet you were nervous.  I would've been too!  Sounds like she's got a great and fun year ahead of her!
0.0 My neighbor keeps letting her dog use the bathroom on her balcony.	1.0 That is just gross!  Have you spoken to her about it?
0.0 It's revolting. I reported her to the HOA but she keeps doing it. I'm going to say something if I catch her out there letting her dog out.	1.0 I hope the HOA does something about that - that's just disgusting!
0.0 The other day I made fish tacos and did nothing else all day but relax on the couch.	1.0 Bet that was a nice calming down.
0.0 Very. It was nice and chill and low pressure, just how I like it.	1.0 Did you get up to anything else fun?
0.0 I did a walk a thon last week for back to school drive and needy kids it was s long walk but I finished it I felt so happy. 	1.0 That sounds awesome, i bet you feel proud! Its nice to do things for kids who are in need.
0.0 I did before the walk I was un-assured I would finish but I did so I was overly proud and it was a great cause that raised lots of money. 	1.0 Of course! Dont let fear of not finishing stop you from doing anything!
0.0 Went out to eat with my boyfriend the other day. Saw our waiter pick his nose and wipe it on his shirt.	1.0 Oh gross, I would lose my appetite
0.0 It really was gross. I was so grossed out I asked to get moved to the bar so we could get a different server.	1.0 Yeah, I would probably just leave the restaurant altogether
0.0 I am so scared of snakes there was one in my back yard a few weeks ago.	1.0 Oh my goodness, that is no fun.  Was it poisonous?
0.0 When I looked it up on line it was one of the garden snakes but I'm still frightened by them all lol even the harmless ones. 	1.0 They can still bite, so it's better safe than sorry.  My father-in-law just got bitten by a black snake recently-not poisonous-but still painful.
0.0 I'm a neat freak and my house has to stay clean and in place always such a pet peeve of mines. 	1.0 Do you have OCD?
0.0 Very bad and when my family has the house out of place I become so furious I just like things clean and in order.	1.0 I just love when the house is clean, makes you feel good.
0.0 My supervisor totally stole all the credit for a client I brought in.	1.0 That's a bad supervisor. Did you call him/her out on it?
0.0 I totally did. And let the CEO know about his behavior.	1.0 I hope he got in trouble!
0.0 I start back college next week I can't wait to finish getting my degree for me and my family. 	1.0 Oh most are dreading going back to school. What's your major?
0.0 I'm going for nursing and I have dreaded going back for 6 years now but my support system pushed me to follow my dream I'm thankful to have them.	1.0 Nursing can be difficult, but if you have determination and a good support system, I'm sure you'll do great!
0.0 I recently applied for a promotion at work.	1.0 How'd it go?
0.0 I didn't get it.	1.0 I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope another opportunity comes up.
0.0 I'm shopping for a new bicycle! Can't wait to pick one out.	1.0 That sounds like fun!  Are you big into biking?
0.0 I have been recently, yes. I'm using an old beat up hand-me-down mountain bike so getting the right bike for me is going to be so much fun.	1.0 Mountain biking is great.  Is is really theraputic.  I hope you enjoy your new bike
0.0 The crime rate in my city is so high right now it breaks my heart and things need to change.	1.0 That's horrible. What can people do to change things?
0.0 First thing get the young crowd out the streets and take the weapons away a 7 year old passed this weekend because of this it is so heart breaking.	1.0 Yes! The weapons thing is so important. 
0.0 Found out recently that one of my best friends from back home died in an accident.	1.0 Oh my gosh! That is horrible! I am so sorry to hear that.
0.0 Thank you. I don't even have it in me to call her parents and offer my condolences yet, it's just too shocking.	1.0 I understand that. Just give it some time and call when you are ready.
0.0 I started my new job last week and already I feel part of the team. 	1.0 That's great. Getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes.
0.0 It is and that's why I was nervous but the staff was so kind and open. 	1.0 That sounds like a wonderful place. I'm kinda jealous hahaha.
0.0 One time someone kicked my dog!	1.0 That's awful! What did you do?
0.0 Nothing! My dog was just walking passed him!	1.0 No. I mean did you yell at the person or anything after they did it?
0.0 I got laid off from a job that I really used to love.	1.0 Woah that's really bad!! Is it due to cost cutting? They let you off.
0.0 Sort of, the company was being run into the ground by poor management. It hurt at first but then I realized just how much I'd started to hate the work and the company.	1.0 it happens!! i hope you will find a better job with a better company!!
0.0 I can't believe I lost my phone today while running errands.	1.0 Oh no, that's the worst.
0.0 Sad part is I have no idea which store that's why I am so upset.	1.0 I hope you can get it back somehow!
0.0 I ended up on one of those "Top 40 under 40" lists for people in my profession. Felt pretty good.	1.0 That is an amazing accomplishment.  What field are you in?
0.0 Finance, basically, but it was a little broader than that. I wish my mom were still around, she would have been so happy.	1.0 I'm sure you know that she is so proud of you!  That is really incredible!  Congratulations!
0.0 I was shocked my husband bought me flowers today out of the blue.	1.0 That is so romantic.  They weren't for any occasion?
0.0 Nope not at all, that's why I was so shocked! 	1.0 Were they your favorites?
0.0 I was so grossed out about the molded bread I bought today.	1.0 Oh yuck. Did you get a chance to return it to the store?
0.0 I tried to, but they had a no refund policy. 	1.0 That's crazy! I'd leave it on the counter at the store. Hopefully you aren't out much money.
0.0 Seeing my kids face when I finally brought a puppy home was priceless! 	1.0 Wow that must have been amazing!
0.0 It really was, and I got it on video too.	1.0 They're going to remember that forever
0.0 While my car was parked on the street in front of my house last week, someone ran into it and left a huge dent.	1.0 Dang, that sucks. Did you ever catch the culprit?
0.0 No, they didn't leave a insurance card or anything, just drove off. Some people are so worthless.	1.0 Yeah, that guy sounds like a jerk. Did your insurance cover the dent?
0.0 Last month my dog Skippy passed away. He was 18 years old.	1.0 Oh wow! My dog Jr died of old age too.
0.0 Man it's hard. He has been like my best friend since I was a teenager.	1.0 Oh, Did something happen to him?
0.0 My dog died of old age today.	1.0 I am sorry to hear that. Mine died of old age as well last month.
0.0 I am sorry that happened too. I never thought I would be this upset over a dog.	1.0 Me neither, but in the end, I really didn't think about him as a dog, he was just my buddy. I hope fond memories of him get you through this.
0.0 I waited the longest three weeks of my life to get something I ordered online.	1.0 That can be so aggravating. Did the company make it up to you for being so late?
0.0 It got worse. When it finally arrived, the box was all busted up and my item was broken. So yeah, safe to say they had a lot to make up for.	1.0 At least they made up for it. If they had not I wouldn't use them again.
0.0 My husband has been getting on my nerves worrying about his football team losing.	1.0 I know the feeling. What team is he rooting for? 
0.0 He is crazy about the Falcons.	1.0 I don't even know what team that is, haha. Football is lost on me. 
0.0 I am also sure I fixed my computer today.	1.0 Oh that's good, last time my computer broke was a day before I left the country
0.0 That would be a nightmare! All I had to do was replace the fan.	1.0 I took it to the apple store and it actually got fixed in 5 mins, just needed a hardware reset
0.0 My husband was just sent to Iraq and I already miss him so much.	1.0 Oh my goodness, is he with the armed forces?
0.0 Yes the army, he will be there for 2 years.	1.0 I cannot imagine how hard that is on the family and the soldier.  While I can't bring him home quicker, I do want to say thank you to you, him and your family for your sacrifice.
0.0 I am in shock ever since my house caught on fire while I was at work.	1.0 That is horrible, did anyone get hurt?
0.0 No, thank goodness no one was home, but their is nothing left of our house.	1.0 Hopefully you had insurance and somewhere to stay.
0.0 One time I heard a large knock on my door while I was sleeping	1.0 That is scary.  What was it?
0.0 It was a couple of drug addicts trying to come in!	1.0 Gosh It's worse than I thought it would be.  What did you do?
0.0 i have very low mark	1.0 Sorry to hear that. What happened on the test?
0.0 exam mark is low in school	1.0 Hopefully next time you will get a better score and study more!
0.0 am so happy for my brother, he graduated with honors	1.0 He must be very smart
0.0 yah, he had done his best	1.0 It paid off. Wish I was smart like that
0.0 I am alone in the house my parents travelled, i feel lonely and afraid	1.0 Oh no. How old are you?
0.0 am 22 years of age	1.0 Is there anyone you could go and visit and maybe stay the night?
0.0 I feel lonely my friend did not make to join me i watching a movie	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that.
0.0 yah, i decided to sleep	1.0 I hope things are better next time.
0.0 Today is my anniversary! My husband planned an amazing day! He bought me my favorite chocolates and is taking me to a concert tonight! I had no idea about the concert!	1.0 That's great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships!
0.0 He usually doesn't do this much! I guess after years of hinting, he's finally picking up on them! haha	1.0 Lol! Oh geez- so many take years to get it ugh! But at least he finally has! I hope he is very romantic too!
0.0 haha yeah it does! we've been together almost 15 years.	1.0 Congrats <3
0.0 I had my front door open and a cat (not mine) ran in my house.	1.0 Not yours? That is so weird, usually they  are on their way OUT not IN! Lol
0.0 I know! we were all surprised. My god was going nuts and my cat hid under the couch while we chased the stray around trying to get it out.	1.0 Did you eventually get it out? I would have been flipping bonkers! 
0.0 This has been the worst year ever for tornadoes in our area. This past spring we spent 5 hours in our basement due to all the tornadoes in our area.	1.0 That sounds terrifying! Im glad you have a basement though, it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in!
0.0 Yes, a lot of people don't have basements, and that would be really bad. It's hard to explain to a three year old why you are in such a dark, scary place, especially when the power is all out.	1.0 Oh your right, I have an almost 3 year old and I wouldn't know how to explain it as well! That is so hard sometimes because you don't know what to say!
0.0 I was in the grocery store. I found what I needed on the top shelf. I climbed onto the bottom shelf but ended up knocking everything down!	1.0 Oh my goodness, are you alright? I bet you created a mess!
0.0 yeah! The only thing that was hurt was my pride! I've never tried to check out so quickly!	1.0 I hope you can laugh a little about it now!
0.0 My favorite band is doing their last tour. My husband bought me tickets to see their concert! He surprised me with them today!	1.0 That sounds like a great gift. That is going to be a great time.
0.0 It is! I'm really excited for it! It's tonight, so it was also a big surprise! 	1.0 Wow. I am sure you will remember this for a long time. You are going to have to think of a great surprise for him now.
0.0 Last month, my dog Duke passed away. I got him when he was just a puppy 17 years ago.	1.0 I'm sorry to hear about that. It sounds like, to me, that he lived a long life with you though, and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him. I'm worried for my girlfriend and what she'll do when that happens to her and her dog
0.0 Yeah, we did everything together. I still have to stop myself from calling him when I go to bed at night. It's amazing how close we can get to our pets.	1.0 That's crazy, and a little heart-breaking too. I'm envious of the bond and routine it sounds like you guys had. I have yet to develop a bond like that with a pet. I hope I do at some point
0.0 I was driving around my old neighborhood and seen that the house I grew up in had burned down.	1.0 That's so sad...Did you have a lot of good memories in that house?
0.0 I spent birth till I was 17 living there, so literally all of my child hood memories. 	1.0 I'm so sorry :( At least you have your memories to look back on.
0.0 my wife got a flat tire on her way home from work and a man was kind enough to stop and help her change the tire.	1.0 That was really nice of him. I know that she had to be relieved.
0.0 As was I. I was about 50 miles away at the time and she was on the side of the highway.	1.0 Someone was watching over her.
0.0 Just over 2 years ago, my wife and I got divorced. It was so strange being in our big house all alone without her and the kids.	1.0 How long had you been married ?
0.0 Just short of 9 years. She met someone online in WoW of all places and just up and moved in with him.	1.0 Hmm. That's a bit of a strange story.
0.0 Back when I was in college, I crossed a street in wrong place and got a ticket.	1.0 I hate to hear that. I hate tickets. There are so many other things I would rather spend my money on.
0.0 Exactly, especially when you get one for just walking.	1.0 Yeah, that is such a silly thing to get a ticket for.
0.0 My wife and I are going to buy are very first brand new car this week.	1.0 Cool, what are you getting?
0.0 A Chevy Cruze. We have been working hard to get our credit score up to get a really good interest rate.	1.0 That's a nice car, you are going to enjoy it.
0.0 I took my three children camping recently, and we had a great time.	1.0 Neat! We took our daughter and her cousin camping about 2 weeks ago! Did ya'll build a fire?
0.0 Of course!  I have found that the key to a great camping experience is to have a checklist of what to bring, and follow it.	1.0 That's defiantly a priority! I hope you brought everything that you need. Forgetting something can be a pain
0.0 My daughter finally master the 1-6 times. We worked very hard on it this summer!	1.0 The 1-6 times as in multiplication?  Teaching children is so rewarding.
0.0 Yes in multiplication! I'm glad she's finally grasped them. Now we just need to work on 6-12 hahaha	1.0 I bet she was super excited to get it all down.
0.0 My daughter starts public school for the first time in 3 years! I think she is going to do great but she's a little bit nervous.	1.0 What grade is she in?
0.0 She is in 5th grade.	1.0 What kind of school was she at before?
0.0 Me and my family just came back from vacation we had a great time.	1.0 Where did you go ?
0.0 We went to Disney world in Orlando, Fl to see my kids have a great time made me happy can't wait for our next vacation.	1.0 We went there a few years back. Had a great time.
0.0 Well, I finally got a call back from that job I interviewed for the other day.	1.0 Awesome news!  What was the response?
0.0 Well, they decided not to hire me. This stinks.	1.0 Oh.  Not so good news then :(  I'm sorry.  I'm sure you'll find something!
0.0 My wife held a surprise birthday party for me. It was totally unexpected and I was shocked when I came home and so many people were there.	1.0 That's awesome, I bet you were overjoyed with it!
0.0 I couldn't believe that no one let the cat out of the bag. It must have been hard to plan.	1.0 You never know if someone is going to slip and spoil it for you, that's true!
0.0 Last week during the night someone came into my yard and stole my push mower.	1.0 Oh no!  Do you have any way of finding out who did it?
0.0 No, I called the police but it's almost impossible to track. I had to chained to a steel post, but they cut the chain with bolt cutters I guess. I sure hate thieves.	1.0 Yeah, thieves are terrible.  I mean, who would steal a mower?
0.0 My food had hair in it at a restaurant worst experience ever.	1.0 what did you do?
0.0 I called the manager over and they offered to redo the food and pay for it but I was so sicken and upset I said no thank you it ruined my whole appetite. 	1.0 yea i can see that, it happens but it sucks
0.0 I'm not one to like scary movies that much only with my husband since he loves them so much.	1.0 well atleast you watch them with him! i dont like them either. 
0.0 We watched the new movie IT I was a little frightened and creep out especially because I'm afraid of clowns lol.	1.0 Oh no, no thank you! lol ahhh i cant even. 
0.0 My wife is going away on a business trip soon.... she'll be gone for a couple of weeks.	1.0 That'll be tough.  Do you have anything you can do to keep busy?
0.0 Well, I might do some work on the house. But it's going to be awfully quiet around here.	1.0 I bet.  It's sometimes surprising how much your life revolves around the other person being in the house.
0.0 Ugh, my neighbor keeps playing his music really loud at night when I'm trying to sleep.	1.0 spray water over there
0.0 Ha, that's not a bad idea. I do need to have a word with him about it though at least.	1.0 thats good, you should
0.0 Someone at work keeps stealing my lunch from the fridge! So infuriating!	1.0 Could you get with your HR department to see if they can assist?
0.0 I might give that a try. But whoever did it had probably better hope that I don't find out who they are!	1.0 What would you do to them?
0.0 I don't like the dark.	1.0 Yea, I used to hate it too.
0.0 I get so worried about something happening to me.	1.0 Like a paranormal type fear or a human with intent to harm type fear?
0.0 I've been stuck for several weeks on a part in this video game I've been playing...	1.0 is it really hard? or you just have not have that much time to paly
0.0 It's pretty tough. But it doesn't matter now... I let a friend of mine have a try, and he got through it right away! It was pretty impressive to see.	1.0 yeah some people are just naturaly good at video games
0.0 So the fiance managed to rewire one of the wall outlets yesterday!	1.0 That's pretty impressive, does he have any training or just all self taught?
0.0 A little bit of both!  I didn't know he had these skills but it was really neat to watch!	1.0 Well it's certainly nice to have someone around with handy knowledge like that!
0.0 Ugh, my neighbor's dog just keeps barking all day long. It's driving me insane.	1.0 That is frustrating!  We have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs.  So annoying all day!
0.0 It really is. And I've talked to him a few times about it, but he doesn't seem to care at all.	1.0 I am sure he thinks it's his world, the rules dont apply to him.  Sorry you have to deal with that people can be so rude
0.0 My brother is getting out of jail next week.	1.0 Well you must be happy about it.
0.0 Not really... I'm the one that turned him in. And I'm scared that he might know about that.	1.0 Oh! that is bad then.  Be careful.
0.0 I have a Dr appointment tomorrow to make sure my cancer is still in remission.	1.0 I hope you hear good news.
0.0 I think I will. It's been 7 years since my last treatment. I still get nervous when I have my checkups though.	1.0 I understand. I guess you'll always feel that way.
0.0 My brother is supposed to be paying me back for the food I bought for him last week...	1.0 It was nice of you to buy him food, but I'm thinking he didn't pay you back.
0.0 Nope, I've been waiting for a few days, and I could really use that money now.	1.0 I'm sorry. I know it sucks to need money and be counting on it, and then you don't get it. I hope he pays you back soon.
0.0 I stepped out of my front door this morning... and right into an unpleasant surprise that my neighbor's dog left for me.	1.0 Ugh! I use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway! At least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise.
0.0 Yeah.... the smell was so bad. It took forever to get that off of my shoe.	1.0 Does this happen often? I'd let my neighbor know about it.
0.0 I got a phone call from a friend that I haven't heard from in a really long time.	1.0 That's great! You must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them.
0.0 I was! It was so great hearing from her again.	1.0 I bet you had tons of catching up to do!
0.0 I have a meeting with my boss in a few hours...	1.0 The way you wrote that makes it seem like you're anticipating something bad... Do you mind if I ask what you're expecting to happen?
0.0 See, that's the thing... I have no idea what to expect. That's why I'm so nervous about it.	1.0 Interesting... well then at least that leaves the possibility for something good instead. If you're not sure what it could be, then at least it's not some obvious mistake or negligence on your part. I hope for the best for you
0.0 My mother is getting very old. And she really isn't in great health these days...	1.0 That is unfortunate, my own mother was ill for several years, she is getting older as well. Do you get to see her often?
0.0 Yeah, I try to go see her at least twice a week. I'm not sure how much longer she'll be with us.	1.0 Just spend what time you can with her, I'd like to say something really profound but aging parents is a situation that just sucks. Sorry you are having to deal with it.
0.0 When I was out of work my car broke down and since it was my only car a friend of mine actually gave me his old car to replace it. It was such a nice gesture.	1.0 That was great of him!
0.0 It was. I insisted that I pay him after I got a job but he wouldn't take the money.	1.0 He sounds very nice!
0.0 I finished a major work assignment in a short amount of time	1.0 Oh really what was the assignment
0.0 It was a presentation that had to be quickly put together.  My supervisor seemed pleased	1.0 It's always great to get back positive feedback!
0.0 I remember when the PS4 was first launching.  It was the first game console I ever ordered onilne and I was really looking forward to having it delivered.	1.0 What was it like when it showed up on your door?
0.0 I was watching the front door like a hawk, and constantly checking for online tracking updates.  I kept worrying that someone would steal it of my porch if I didn't get it right away.	1.0 Thats hilarious, You finally got it though uhuh?
0.0 A friend was supposed to meet me for lunch, but didn't show	1.0 Im sure they had a good excuse.
0.0 He said he was busy with work, so I suppose so	1.0 Oh I see. Hopefully its just that one time where he couldnt get to his phone to let you know.
0.0 I accidentally left my phone at a restaurant	1.0 Oh crap! how long untill you realized?
0.0 A few minutes after leaving, I was able to get it back	1.0 Thats so good, man I have done that a time of two.
0.0 I'm sure I will pass my law exam.	1.0 I am sure you will as well. Confidence is great!
0.0 Thank you. I'm almost done with school!	1.0 Congratulations. You have done great!
0.0 A friend got a new car	1.0 That's really cool. What kind of car?
0.0 BMW, it was a model I had been looking to get myself 	1.0 That  sounds like a really awesome car!
0.0 I carry around the ticket stub from the first concert I attended in my wallet.  It brings back good memories I had spending time with my friends.	1.0 Aww, that's really sweet and sentimental. I like that. Can you still read the words on it?
0.0 The edges are a little frayed but I can still make out everything on it.  I keep it in a zippered compartment to preserve it.  Maybe I'll frame it someday.	1.0 I was going to say, yeah, that's the kind of thing I would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office. How cool!
0.0 Yeah, it's a nice little souvenir to remind me of good times.  It was a great concert and experience for all of us.	1.0 Who did you go see? And are you still friends with all the same people? I wonder if any of them kept their ticket stubs too.
0.0 Hey, the other day I didn't have a pen while trying to fill out some paperwork	1.0 that stinks. what did you do?
0.0 Yeah! Well I was in a parking garage so I went walking to try and find someone to borrow a pen from	1.0 and did you find one?
0.0 I did, this really nice woman just gave me a very fancy one. She told me to keep it!	1.0 oh that is awesome. and you got a fancy pen out of it
0.0 Hi! I had ear surgery a few months ago	1.0 Did it went well?
0.0 Yeah it went really well actually, the result was better than I had hoped for in fact!	1.0 That is great. What was the issue with your ear?
0.0 I moved over the weekend.  Although it took about 5 hours to load the truck, when we unloaded the next day it took a little under an hour.	1.0 you made quick work out of that
0.0 Yeah, I was really happy that the unloading took as little time as it did.	1.0 i wish i could unload that fast
0.0 I was scared of the spider in my bathroom.	1.0 oh goodness. that has happened to me before. i could not sleep
0.0 It was a brown recluse. I had no clue that I had poisonous spiders at my house.	1.0 how in the world did it get in your house? were you able to kill it?
0.0 My girlfriend moved in this past weekend.  I am really excited to start this next chapter in my life.	1.0 OOOOOOOOOO NICE!
0.0 Yeah, I'm excited.  First girlfriend that I've lived with but she is pretty awesome so I'm glad it finally happened.	1.0 Well you two have fun tonight.  I won't tell your parents about all this.
0.0 I got a new job and it is so great and I have my old supervisor to thank she's the best.	1.0 Why you need to thank her? Is she the one that helped you to find the new job?
0.0 She was a great influence and gave me words of encouragement to branch out and go for more then our company job.	1.0 She is very nice person. That is great.
0.0 I am nervous about my son starting school this year.	1.0 Oh. Will he be starting elementary school?
0.0 Yes, he will be starting Kindergarten this year.	1.0 aw he's at that precious age where you have to let his hand go, hu?
0.0 My dog had cancer and the vet advised us to put our dog to sleep today.	1.0 Damn why'd you have to tell me that...Gawd that's freakin sad, jeezus
0.0 I am soo upset, and worse I have to tell the kids when they get home.	1.0 I wish you and your fam peace happiness love and good health.
0.0 I am so mad my neighbor killed my dog because she was mad at me.	1.0 What? Do you have evidence supporting this
0.0 I sure do I have it on video and made a report with the police already.	1.0 Good hope that bitch goes to hell...sorry I love animals and my mom's dog died the same way
0.0 I am so annoyed my neighbor's trash always ends up in my yard.	1.0 That is a big deal.  What are you going to do?
0.0 I have tried everything, but they keep doing it even after paying huge fines.	1.0 I would throw trash in their yard.
0.0 My husband has been on his second tour in Iraq. Seems like I wont see him in forever. 	1.0 He sounds like a real hero though. I hope he comes home safe soon
0.0 Thank you, The kids and I miss him terribly. 	1.0 I can only imagine. At least you have each other 
0.0 I lost everything in the fire today.	1.0 Are you and your family okay?
0.0 We are thank heavens, but we lost everything. 	1.0 I am sorry, you can replace it though
0.0 I once left all cash and didn't have any to pay for a metro ride, some random girl paid for me without saying a word.	1.0 Wow!  How kind is that!  Their really are kind people left in this world.  How did you respond?
0.0 Yes, and I am thankful for those kind of people.	1.0 *There* oops.  Did you ever find out her name?  Or find out a way to thank her?
0.0 Last week on the way to work, I did not notice my wife had ran my car so low on gas and I ended up running out of gas on the freeway.	1.0 On no! Did you have to walk, or did you call for service?
0.0 A nice man stopped, help me push my car to the shoulder and even had a can of gas he let me use in his trunk. Talk about a nice guy.	1.0 Wow, you got lucky! Did you give him a tip?
0.0 I got caught cheating on my test. I feel so horrible.	1.0 Why did you feel you had to cheat? I am sure you could have passed if you had studied.
0.0 I just wanted to make sure I passed. But now I have a big 0.	1.0 Well, don't let this one situation define you. Use it as a learning experience and move on, and do you best not to repeat it.
0.0 I had an accident today and I never want to show my face again at work.	1.0 That's so sad! What on earth happened?
0.0 I accidentally peed my pants when I was laughing. 	1.0 Now that is quite embarrassing! What did your co-workers say?
0.0 My daughter made straight A's all year. I am so happy.	1.0 That is wonderful!  She must be so proud of herself and I know you are proud of her.  Its great that she likes learning so much.
0.0 Yes I agree. I let her choose our vacation this summer. She cried because she was so happy.	1.0 Awww, what a great idea!  That's so cute! Where are you guys going?
0.0 I could never send my parents to a nursing home. I look after them now.	1.0 You are such a good person to do that!
0.0 Thank you! They say they feel like they are the kids and it makes them feel young again.	1.0 It's crazy how the tables turn!
0.0 I think I will never walk into the local grocery store again.	1.0 Why do you say that
0.0 It was raining today, and when I walked into the store I slipped and fell right on my face.	1.0 Oh no, were you okay
0.0 I can't show my face in the bank ever again!	1.0 Oh my goodness, what happened? Did they find out you owe money to the local crime families? Those bank employees need to mind their own business, am I right!?
0.0 How did you guess? You are exactly right. Now they are talking about alerting the police!	1.0 That is absolutely unacceptable. Snitches get stitches, that's what I say. Tell me where they're at and I'll roll up on 'em and tell 'em what for. Just say the word. I've got your back.
0.0 I need someone to stay with my elderly mother for a few hours in my home. 	1.0 have you asked your friends for family?
0.0 No one is available. She asked someone that I don't know and they are coming. I am a little uneasy.	1.0 i would def feel that way.its hard when you dont know the person or can trust them
0.0 My husband just told me the best news ever!	1.0 Oh yeah? And what news might that be?
0.0 My husband just signed with the NFL. I never knew he was that good!	1.0 Nice! Did he sign up to be a waterboy?
0.0 So, I just found our my husband is cheating on me.	1.0 Oh my goodness, that's terrible!
0.0 I am soo mad. I can't believe he did this after being married for 15 years.	1.0 What do you plan on doing?
0.0 I don't think I will go outside in the dark ever again.	1.0 uh oh. did something happen?
0.0 Yes, I was robbed at gun point while walking home from work.	1.0 That must be traumatizing. Most people wouldn't want to go out alone after that. It's understandable.
0.0 I have been pacing waiting to hear back from Walmart after my interview. 	1.0 Do you think you will get the job?
0.0 Not sure, but I really need this job to support my kids.	1.0 I hope you end up getting it!
0.0 I like to watch all the music and guitar covers on YouTube.  There's a lot of talented folks out there nowadays.	1.0 Oh definitely, Youtube is a great platform for these talented people
0.0 Yeah, it never ceases to amaze me the kinds of things you can see on YouTube.  Endless content to discover.	1.0 Yeah, my favorite is watching short comedy videos of my favorite drag queens
0.0 I am still waiting to hear the results from the doctor.	1.0 do you think there something wrong
0.0 They think I may have brain cancer. I can't seem to even sit still waiting for that phone call.	1.0 oh no thats terrible Im sorry to hear that
0.0 I am waiting to find out if I really won the lottery.	1.0 Me too! I bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night!
0.0 Wow. I spent $500.00 myself. I hope it pays off!	1.0 You and I both! No matter who wins, let's promise to split the pot.
0.0 I will be going on a once in a life time trip tomorrow.	1.0 Oh nice, where are you going?
0.0 I will be going on my first cruise. 	1.0 Wow, I've never been on a cruise before. I think it sounds like a lot of fun
0.0 I can never thank my mom enough.	1.0 Why? What did she do?
0.0 She helped us pay off our house so it didn't go into foreclosure. 	1.0 She is a special woman.
0.0 I am not sure how to address to my husband about how I feel about him getting a phone number from another girl.	1.0 I would be downright furious. Start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner. That should be a good segway into the conversation.
0.0 That is how I feel. I don't think he understands how it makes me feel inside. 	1.0 Oh, he certainly will when he feels the hot, guilty tears running down his face from that strong, independent, jealous filled slap!
0.0 I am still in shock at the damage yesterdays flood caused. 	1.0 Was any of your stuff damaged?
0.0 Yes, our whole house was swept out to sea.	1.0 Oh wow! I am sorry to hear that. Maybe you can go find it and sail it to go kill Moby Dick to make up for the damages.
0.0 I know I got this job, just waiting for the conformation. 	1.0 Exciting! Are you moving to a new company?
0.0 No, this is the first job I have ever had just out of high school.	1.0 Oh fun! I'm so excited for you. Try to learn as much as possible from this job and ask for career development opportunities!
0.0 I never thought I would see something this gross ever!	1.0 Oh geez! What on earth was it!
0.0 I saw a guy pick a piece of chewed gum off the sidewalk and put it in his mouth.	1.0 That is FRIGGIN revolting!!! I would have lost my lunch right then and there!
0.0 Today, was the worst day ever!	1.0 No way. What happened? If honestly, almost all my days are like this. So, worst has become normal for me
0.0 That is so sad. I was turned down for my promotion at work to someone with less experience than me. 	1.0 Don't get it personally. Good performance will always catch other's attention. Just continue doing your work
0.0 I am pretty happy with my life right now.	1.0 That's awesome! Always good to be content with life.
0.0 It took a long time. But I always tell people to plan for the future! 	1.0 It's good to be prepared for anything because you never know what could happen.
0.0 I never knew I would feel this much love having kids.	1.0 Definately! I have one daughter and twins on the way... I foresee love overload. How many do you have?
0.0 Congrats. I love every bit of motherhood. I have 3 kids. They are 7, 5, and 2	1.0 Thanks, Motherhood truly is amazing
0.0 Do you felt sad or emotioned during your work	1.0 Not really, do you?
0.0 Some time I felt disgusted with my work	1.0 Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, i hope it picks up for you, maybe listen to a little music to lift your spirits
0.0 I didn't think I would feel this bad for stealing diapers.	1.0 Oof, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do I guess
0.0 I felt so bad I brought them back. I am happy I wasn't arrested. But it was only half a pack I brought back.	1.0 Well you tried to make things right, you're still a good person
0.0 Do you feel that you are satisfied with your work	1.0 i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me. are you?
0.0 Great! I am very happy with work, I am loving it	1.0 im glad to hear that!
0.0 I would be in bad shape if I didn't pack extra clothes.	1.0 What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?
0.0 We went on vacation. And we all ended up with the stomach virus so you can guess from there lol	1.0 What are you packing extra clothes for? Did you go somewhere did something happen?
0.0 I am still shocked my husband bought tickets to the concert.	1.0 What concert is it? Are you excited to go?
0.0 Super excited to see Taylor Swift! He knew I was a fan.	1.0 OH MY GOD, I'm so jealous, she isn't coming to my city this time. You're gonna have a great time
0.0 I just found out I was having twins. I already have 3 kids.	1.0 Wow, that will be a busy house
0.0 Yes, I agree. I was super worried, but decided to think more positive and I know I will be able to handle it.	1.0 That's a great attitude, I hope you and your family stay happy and healthy
0.0 I feel so bad lying to my husband.	1.0 What did you lie about, are you going to tell him?
0.0 I might as well since I feel so bad. I pretended to be sick because I didn't want to spend 3 days at my in law's house this holiday weekend.	1.0 HAHAHA if anything that is excusable, noone like inlaws!
0.0 There have been more tornadoes in my area this year so far than any year in recent memory. We have spent a lot of time in the basement.	1.0 How scary! I'm terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here
0.0 It's so much worse when the power is out and all we have is a few candles and flashlights.	1.0 Well I hope nothing crazy happens and you guys stay safe!
0.0 my husband threw me an unexpected party for my birthday!	1.0 Wow, that's very nice of him! Was there a lot of people there?
0.0 Yes almost my entire family! The only one that wasn't there was my son. He couldn't come because he had to work.	1.0 That's too bad. I hope you had a blast!
0.0 There is suppose to be a huge storm coming. I went to the store and got supplies so i am ready.	1.0 That's a good idea! It's always smart to be on the safe side.
0.0 We usually don't have horrible storms so i never do it, but i have heard this one is going to be a bad one.  i just want to be ready	1.0 I've done that as well where nothing ends up happening but I bought all this stuff. You never know what could happen though.
0.0 I am looking forward to going on vacation in october! i need a vacation	1.0 Where are you going on vacation?
0.0 My husband and i are going to the smokeys.  I have been but he hasn't. 	1.0 That should be fun, what do you plan to do there?
0.0 I was walking through walmart and noticed people staring. i went to the bathroom and to check my clothing and i had a huge brown stain on my rear! i sat in chocolate, i was moritified	1.0 That must of been horrible.
0.0 I can't stop thinking about it.  I keep replaying the scene in my head, it was so bad.	1.0 I am sure people forgot already.
0.0 I am suppose to start a new job tomorrow. I am not sure I am going to like it	1.0 What job is it?
0.0 i will be working at a daycare. i love kids, but i am not sure i will like working with so many at once.	1.0 Only one way to find out.
0.0 My son is getting ready to go into the military! I am so pleased with him	1.0 What branch of the military then?
0.0 The marines. He has always wanted to join.  I am glad he is finally getting to. 	1.0 The marines is by far my favorite so good for him!
0.0 My electricity is out again! I pay a lot for the service, and i can never count on it. It goes out when the wind blows!	1.0 Oh no that's horrible. Have you complained to the electric company?
0.0 Yes but i always get the same answer, we are working to improve the infrastructure.. blah blah. I am seriously considering solar.	1.0 I would too at this point. It might be more reliable.
0.0 I think I am going to have to serve on a jury and I am terrified	1.0 That will be no fun.
0.0 No.  I hope it isn't a murder trial or something heartbreaking.	1.0 Don't you have to be selected first?
0.0 I can't believe I lost at Bingo! I spent 40 dollars and didn't win a penny	1.0 That sucks! i hate losing money as well. 
0.0 Yes, I swear there were 5 people sitting all around me that won several games.  It's just not fair.	1.0 That's how I always feel at those things as well!
0.0 Have you ever been to the zoo just to realize that animals can be just as good as humans?	1.0 I do enjoy the zoo and the animals. I think they could be just as good.
0.0 Yes, I am happy somebody shares this with me.	1.0 I think it's a good outlook.
0.0 I almost adopted a child once, but now I'm glad I didn't do it, sometimes we should stay rational.	1.0 Hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own.
0.0 I don't know if this is something I'll ever be ready for.	1.0 It's a tough choice to make, and not everyone has to raise a child.
0.0 Have you ever mistaken a situation for something it is not and was ready for anything?	1.0 i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt. but not sure about the ready for anything
0.0 It's just that the other day I mistaken a guard for a tour guide and almost got in a fight.	1.0 almost? so the situation resolved itself?
0.0 I have an interview with a local ad agency tomorrow. I hope I get it!	1.0 What kind of interview?
0.0 An interview for a job.	1.0 Really? That is cool
0.0 yesterday my family surprised me on my birthday	1.0 How exactly?
0.0 well i came back from work kind of sad because i thought nobody remembered my birthday and as soon as i went inside they screamed happy birthday , not gonna lie i got really happy.	1.0 I bet you needed help to take all the presents back home.
0.0 I got into a wrong part of town the other day, I was glad to get out from there.	1.0 oh my god, how did you get out of there?
0.0 I realized I could walk very fast if I want to.	1.0 that sounds great.
0.0 In the past and even today I always felt strong in unfamiliar situations.	1.0 That's a great asset to have emotionally I think.
0.0 I agree, although I don't really know if you can train yourself to be like that.	1.0 Yeah it might just be something you're born with.
0.0 I have old cassette player and music on it is much better than what I hear on a radio today. 	1.0 I agree. Music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day.
0.0 Yes, today it's just all about money and getting physical.	1.0 Hopefully music nowadays can take a note from the good old days and change their tune.
0.0 yesterday i went to the town where i grew up 	1.0 how did that go? did it bring back a lot of memories?
0.0 it did, so much nostalgia!	1.0 im glad to hear that. sounds like a great trip
0.0 So it was supposed to rain, but when I got out it was beautifully sunny.	1.0 Almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in Georgia.  I don't mind the rain as long as I'm inside.  The sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up.  Do you prefer sunny days?
0.0 Sun is what makes me alive, so definitely yes.	1.0 I have to be very careful in the sun.  My allergies and the sun don't mix too well.  I can tolerate the rain much better.  I love the sound of water.
0.0 When I walk past old people I feel fortunate that I'm still young.	1.0 i can agree with that. i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though
0.0 Yes, but this part is inevitable, for now let us enjoy our young years.	1.0 def. make the best of them
0.0 When I feel an urge to get a girlfriend, I simply remember how nice it is to be independent.	1.0 It's good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own.
0.0 Yes, I still think that there are good and bad sides in both of these cases.	1.0 Hopefully one day you will be willing to explore a relationship in a serious way.
0.0 I get angry when people don't use trash cans.	1.0 I once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road. It's amazing how much people litter
0.0 Good for you, instead of tickets this should be a punishment for everyone.	1.0 I wish. People might have more respect if they were forced to clean up other people's trash as well.
0.0 When I wake up, the first thing I do is thank life for having another day to enjoy.	1.0 Are you in a dangerous place?
0.0 No I'm not, but in away we all are in a very dangerous place, aren't we?	1.0 I suppose so. It's great that you value life so much!
0.0 i was with my friend yesterday and by accident i spilled coffee on her laptop	1.0 Oh no. Did it get ruined?
0.0 i got so embarrassed but thankfully it didn't get ruined	1.0 Close call. I once spilt tea over my laptop and the keys were all sticky for a while
0.0 my grandmother passed away last week.	1.0 Really? So sorry for the lose
0.0 i'm really sad because she used to help me with everything 	1.0 Was she sick?
0.0 I entered a contest and I didn't win.	1.0 That's a bummer. It's never fun to not win.
0.0 No it isn't. I felt like I put a lot of effort into it too.	1.0 Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!
0.0 we changed our internet provider last week and the connection is horrible.	1.0 That's not good, we ended up lucky with who we have 
0.0 i wish we did too.. but it's okay 	1.0 Maybe you can find another one or go back to your previous company. Have you double checked with the company to make sure everything is ok? 
0.0 I was one of three finalists for a job promotion where I work. I have more than double the other candidates experience, so I feel really good about my odds.	1.0 that's wonderful! I hope you will get that promotion! What do you do?
0.0 I am a electrical engineer with more than 15 years experience. I have a really good feeling that I am going to get this job.	1.0 Good luck! Whenever you get that promotion we should go celebrate
0.0 i can't wait for summer to finish , i love winter so much	1.0 I agree, plus I love making snowmen! 
0.0 snowmen are my favourite! 	1.0 I always get sad though when they melt 
0.0 Last week I was walking and talking to one of my coworkers and I stepped into a hole I did not see on the job site. I ended up falling and spilling hot coffee all over myself in front of our client.	1.0 Ouch! Did they try to help you back up?
0.0 Yeah, my coworker did, but the damage had already been done. Pretty big shot to the ego to look like such a fool in front of your client.	1.0 Of course! Well, at least you also looked human. We all make mistakes.
0.0 We have had a record number of tornadoes in my area so far this year. My son really hates going into the basement while it is storming outside.	1.0 That sounds really scary!  Is your son afraid or is he use to it?
0.0 He is only three, so it is pretty scary for him each time. I hate to see him that way.	1.0 I would hate that as well. I hope he learns to cope with it.
0.0 I had a client meeting in Dallas, and as I was driving to the airport I heard there was going to be a lot of storms we'd be flying through. I ended up renting a car because I hate flying so much in just calm weather.	1.0 That is a lot of extra money to spen, but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it.  Have you ever looked into calming medications, or meditation to help your nerves?
0.0 I have, but they only cut down the anxiety instead of making it go away completely. Something about hurdling towards earth at a rapid pace in a large metal box alarms me.	1.0 I completely understand that.  My mother in law used to have really bad anxiety about flying, but she did hypnosis and it really helped. 
0.0 Last month, this area got pounded with rainfall. My entire home town was flooded and declared a disaster area.	1.0 Wow. That's intense. Did your home get any damage?
0.0 No, I move away from there some years ago, but I hate seeing the place I grew up basically destroyed now.	1.0 Yeah. I feel for you. It hurts to lose things like that.
0.0 My birthday isn't for another two weeks, but my wife gave me my gift early yesterday. She bought me a brand new laptop because mine was getting old and slow.	1.0 That is awesome.  Happy Birthday!  What kind is it?
0.0 It's a Dell with a I7 and 8 gigs of ram, even has a Nvidia graphics card. She pretty much know what I wanted.	1.0 Is that a gaming computer?
0.0 Last month our area received record amounts of rainfall. The river that is down from my house backed up so bad it flooded my entire house destroying practically everything.	1.0 Sorry to hear about that. Are the damages covered by an insurance?
0.0 Yes, we had insurance that is going to cover it, but it still sucks start from ground zero. Plus, insurance can't really replace some things.	1.0 I understand. It is always difficult to start from ground zero. Good luck.
0.0 My ex took me to six flags and wanted me to ride on a very high roller coaster.	1.0 Interesting....did you do it
0.0 Yeah, but only because he was getting mad at me. I hate heights and I was very unsure about it.	1.0 lol why would he get mad...but did you have fun in the end
0.0 My husband is so lucky I cheat on him like he did.	1.0 Why do you cheat on him?
0.0 I could have. But I didn't. He cheated on me actually.	1.0 Oh I see, why are you still with him then?
0.0 Damn, I really wanted my eBay package to arrive today, but it didn't.	1.0 I know how you feel. Are you also spoiled by amazone prime?
0.0 Indeed, I thought everything came this early.	1.0 Haha, I know. Especially when I purchase firearms related things like ammunition. It has to ship ground.  1 week for shipping?!?!   rage.
0.0 That sucks! I guess ground shipping takes ages in large countries. 	1.0 Yeah, the US is huge, landmass wise.
0.0 I really really wished it would come today, I was even sat at the window looking for postal trucks and everything!	1.0 You can always leave them an angry review online
0.0 I got so mad at my dog the other day.	1.0 What did your dog do?
0.0 He saw the rabbit that lives under my shed eating some grass in my yard, and decided to scare it and chase it away.	1.0 Oh no, well at least he didnt hurt the rabbit.
0.0 I am so upset about what happened yesterday. 	1.0 What happened to you?
0.0 I accidentally can off the road avoiding a deer and totaled my new car.	1.0 That sucks sorry to hear. Are you okay?
0.0 I went to my first concert this weekend I seen Beyonce herself it was so awesome. 	1.0 Oh nice! I bet you'll remember that for a long time
0.0 Yes and I will it was great and her voice and the singers really moved me because even in person it was lovely. 	1.0 I've never been to a concert. I should go see one like you!
0.0 This past weekend I found out a friend of mine I went to school with passed away. He had a heart attack while he slept.	1.0 that's terrible! how does that make you feel?
0.0 It makes me feel old. I mean I am not that old, but to see people my age passing away really makes me think about my own mortality. 	1.0 That is the reality of life, unfortunately! That's what you have to enjoy life now.
0.0 I am upset I have to tell my daughter her pet died.	1.0 That is terrible. How long have you had this pet?
0.0 She had it for 2 years. But I feel I must be honest with her.	1.0 Honesty is vey important. I hope she will not feel too bad.
0.0 I can't believe my husband planned a trip all by him. 	1.0 Where are you going?
0.0 I am still shocked he planned a cruise for 7 days.	1.0 That is going to be so fun!
0.0 I start my diet Monday and let's just say I am not ready to start lol.	1.0 I am never ready. which diet are you trying
0.0 The keto diet and I have started looking up meal preps and workouts but as of non I am so not arranged to start this up I need more time.	1.0 I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started
0.0 I have to look into that one never heard of it thanks.	1.0 your welcome, and I will check out Keto.
0.0 My dogs are my life more like my family I love them.	1.0 My kitties are my family too. Animals are the best.
0.0 Yes they are you can't be lonely with them they are just so warmhearted and loving always. 	1.0 Exactly! I am glad you have them
0.0 I can't believe my husband hid a talent her had from me for 15 years. 	1.0 That sounds interesting.. What was it? And how did you find out? And why did he hide it! If you don't mind me asking, of course...
0.0 I happen to come across all his drawings. He is as good as most professional artists! 	1.0 Oh I see.. Well that's a pretty positive talent then, huh? Maybe you should encourage him to keep doing it. Maybe he misses it. You could get him a present for his birthday or Christmas that was related to drawing tools/pencils and all that.
0.0 I am starting back dancing ballet next month it's been a while since I last danced. 	1.0 how is that working out for you
0.0 A little rusty but I know when I get in the class and hit the floor with my shoes I am more then positive it will be great.	1.0 practice makes perfect
0.0 I hate I keep receiving double bills every month from Comcast.	1.0 omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it? 
0.0 Every month they shut off my service because I didn't pay the second bill. Then I have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors.	1.0 Sounds like a nightmare! total. 
0.0 When I see my wedding picture around the house I always think back to that day.	1.0 Does it make you feel happy about your life since then?
0.0 Yeah, just makes me think back to those times and how it was so different from now.	1.0 Well at least you'll always have your memories as time goes on.
0.0 My favorite football team lost their preseason game and I talked so much smack to everyone saying they was going to win. 	1.0 that's why i don't watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard Redskins fan
0.0 I love the Jaguars I was ashamed I talk a lot of smack to everyone lol I guess me and your uncle need to stay quite next time lol.	1.0 lol no! you shouldn't! that's the best part! Talking smack to each other
0.0 I dislike a careless driver and this morning I was furious with one by my daughters elementary school. 	1.0 Oh I know how you feel! I wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around
0.0 I wish to and the school zone light was flashing but they was driving past the 15 mph minimum a child could have got hurt.	1.0 Thats awful! People should be arrested for that
0.0 I lost some money yesterday in the parking lot I am still so unhappy about that.	1.0 Oh no!  Devastating! I'm so sorry.
0.0 I know it is I lost $100 and was actually on the way to pay my car insurance with that can't believe I was careless. 	1.0 That makes me feel ill so I'm sure you were sick. I hope somehow you make it up!
0.0 I decided to buy my son's supplies for kindergarten, they wanted very specific brands/counts.	1.0 That could turn out expensive. Did they need a particular brand for a particular reason?
0.0 I'm not sure, it was just on the list.  I had a really hard time finding them.	1.0 That's annoying, maybe they should provide links for you next time?
0.0 I just got out of a job interview for a customer assistant role.	1.0 How did it go?
0.0 I think it went well, apart from a few mistakes, hopefully I got the job.	1.0 That is great.  Interviews are very intimidating. 
0.0 I recently had to babysit my cousins, it was a disaster.	1.0 Oh no, what happened?
0.0 They made a mess everywhere in the house. Really was not a good way to earn money.	1.0 There has o be an easier way.  I have always avoided babysitting because I just don't like other peoples kids that much.
0.0 Yesterday was my birthday and I knew my girlfriend had a surprise planned for me, but no idea what it would be.	1.0 So i am guessing she gave you a good surprise?
0.0 An awesome one! All my best friends were there and I got some pretty sweet gifts!	1.0 She's must be a keeper then.
0.0 Against all odds, I won two tickets to go to a music festival last summer.	1.0 That is awesome.  I have never won anything in my life.  What festival was it?
0.0 That's a shame! It was a festival called Pooza Fest. Many punk-rock and acoustic shows!	1.0 Congratulations!  Did you have a good time?
0.0 I won a pair of tickets to go to Rockfest this summer.	1.0 wow thats awesome.  How did you win them? I never win anything cool.
0.0 I won them by sharing and liking a facebook page! Unfortunately, none of my friends could go and so I ended up staying home instead.	1.0 aww that stinks, i hope you were at least able to sell them and make some money
0.0 My coworker constantly calls in.  The last couple weeks he had only come in on Fridays.  We made a friendly bet last night if he would come in today and I was pretty shocked when he actually was here on a Wednesday.	1.0 That is crazy! How is he still employed?
0.0 He went on disability.  He actually was my old roommate so I know he just doesnt like working but at the same time has anxiety issues so he can go that route to not get fired.  It definitely doesnt look good for him though.	1.0 That makes people look bad. I have severe anxiety and still go to work. I get that things are hard but.... its bad to never come in.
0.0 I told my best friends about an incident in where I self-harmed recently.	1.0 I am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings. Its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings.
0.0 Agreed. I was anxious and scared to share, but I'm glad I did; they were really supportive and it's helped me a lot.	1.0 Thats what best friends are for, after all. I hope things have gotten better for you.
0.0 My dog keeps going into my garbage and throwing it all onto the floor!	1.0 Gesh, that's frustrating. I had a dog that used to do that too. Had to get a trash can with a lid.
0.0 That's a good idea, I just haven't found a nice looking one yet. It's really frustrating but I think I'll just get whatever I can at this point.	1.0 We even had to put something heavy on top of the lid to keep it from getting in it. Hopefully that will work for now until you figure something out.
0.0 An eagle landed on my flag pole in my front yard last week!	1.0 That is awe inspiring, very patriotic.  Did you get pictures?
0.0 I did. Not the best pictures because I was using my phone but still, it was really surprising.	1.0 I'm sure, that isn't something you see every day, or would even expect to see ever.  I'm glad you got it documented.
0.0 I've been putting off my exam studying by being productive in other areas of my life.	1.0 Well, that's great. But you probably should study as well. School is very important.
0.0 Yeah... I'm pretty upset in myself for procrastinating, but also proud of what I've been accomplishing. I'm so conflicted in my emotions.	1.0 Yeah, that does sound like a conflicting situation. Well at least you're doing something positive.
0.0 I was helping my girlfriend pack up her sons toys and he had a lite-brite.  I used to have a lite-brite and loved playing with it when I was younger.  It brought back some good memories.	1.0 I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.
0.0 His is a new version too...those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!	1.0 Nope, they only know how to touch screens.
0.0 My girlfriend moved in last weekend.  I really feel like this is the right move for the next steps for us and our relationship.	1.0 That's great! How long have you two been together?
0.0 Almost a year.  We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.	1.0 You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them, so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.
0.0 A friend of mine hadn't taken out her garbage in weeks.	1.0 Oh I'll bet that didn't smell pleasant.
0.0 You got that right. Also there were so many fruit flies around it, I felt sick to my stomach.	1.0 Oh gross.  I hope she won't do that again.
0.0 I really hate moving. My girlfriend just moved in last weekend. Im really happy she moved in but Im also SUPER happy that the move is finally over.	1.0 Moving is the worst.  All those boxes.  ugh. i hope i dont have to do it for awhile
0.0 Haha, the boxes are still being unpacked and probably will be for the next couple weeks.  I'm hoping we dont have to again for a while!	1.0 I hope its good that she moved in with you.  things must be serious
0.0 I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to volunteer for one of my favorite companies at a convention.	1.0 That sounds pretty amazing, what convention was it?
0.0 Otakuthon 2018. It was so amazing, I ended up doing really great!	1.0 I'm so happy for you, it sounds like it was a wonderful opportunity!
0.0 i was looking at my old photo album today, it brought back a lot of memories	1.0 That is always so much fun. Which ones made you feel the most nostalgic?
0.0 the one where i was eating ice cream, oh god i miss eating ice cream	1.0 I know how you feel. I feel guilty about indulging in ice cream the older I get.
0.0 "I told my family I wanted nothing a few Christmas' ago, even if I knew they'd get me something anyways.	1.0 oh yea? and what did they get you?
0.0 I got an Xbox One, and I had no idea how much fun I'd have until I received it.	1.0 Oh nice.  Those are fun.  I love playing video games
0.0 I went for a run last month and the most unexpected thing happened to me.	1.0 Oh yes? What happened?
0.0 I was running on a road with a sidewalk, I turned the corner and saw a deer staring at me. Can't believe I found one in my small suburban neighborhood.	1.0 Oh, that must have been so precious! We had deer around where I used to live - they're gorgeous creatures.
0.0 My little brother was stuck gaming on a horrendously slow computer for years.	1.0 That's not much fun. Did he get a new one recently?
0.0 Kind of. I built myself a new PC, and gave him my previous one. I re-built it for him and made sure everything would work perfectly!	1.0 Wow, you're smart and kind! I wouldn't know where to start re. building a computer. Well done!
0.0 Thanks! Seeing him smile as he played with high frame rates and nice graphics brought me such joy. 	1.0 What a nice thing to do. You seem to get on very well with your little bro.
0.0 I love my siblings so much, they're the best.	1.0 I love my brother, too. He's a great guy. How lucky we are!
0.0 My older sister stole money from me.	1.0 Do you know it was her for sure? That is horrible that you cant trust your own sister.
0.0 Yeah, no one else in the household would ever do something like that. The worst thing is, my parents did nothing about it.	1.0 That is horrible. It sucks that you have to keep such a close eye on your things in front of family. I would be so mad.
0.0 Today I woke from an amazing dream which i had, it brought back a lot of amazing memories, memories which i wish i could go back to...	1.0 I hear you! That sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it's stuff you miss!
0.0 Yeah, but at the same time, it motivated me for the day which was nice	1.0 Thats great! What kind of stuff was in the dreams?
0.0 Last week as we were finishing up on a job site, the client was over joyed at the way we had done the installation. I couldn't help but keep smiling since it was my design.	1.0 That has got to be one of the best feelings. I love being complimented.
0.0 Yes, it is great to see something you designed be put into a working model. 	1.0 You should be proud of yourself. Keep pushing it and work and it will all pay off.
0.0 i was just like the usual, working on my website, and then i saw a disgusting advert which was about society	1.0 Dont put too much weight into those advertisements. Sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you.
0.0 yeah, but i wish it wasn't like this	1.0 I know that feeling. Sometimes they can really get under your skin.
0.0 My girlfriend moved in over the weekend.  We have a ton of boxes to unpack but I am thinking it should be something that can be done in the next couple weeks.	1.0 Thats nice to hear. Hopefully it makes you two happy. I would just unpack the necessities first and move from there.
0.0 I think thats the plan.  After those were just slowly going to go from room to room until everything is done.  Not a huge rush and were both super happy...well I am.  I'm assuming she is too!	1.0 Sounds like a plan! Make sure to hydrate properly because unpacking is cumbersome work!
0.0 today i woke up, and i realised that i am more than content with my life, it made me happy and peaceful 	1.0 That would be a great feeling.  Did something happen to make you feel more content?
0.0 yes, i just realised i have everything i ever wanted in my life	1.0 Thats so awesome! Congrats! I am hoping to get there soon.  I have a lot to be thankful for but I know I need to work on just a little bit before I am fully content.
0.0 Im going to Chicago in a couple weeks.  I havent been there for about 15 years so I'm really looking forward to it.	1.0 oh nice! i know that feeling, is it home? what made you think about going there?
0.0 It isnt home but I went there for family trips when I was younger. My girlfriends friend is having a baby shower and lives there so I'm tagging along and were going to make a long weekend out of it!	1.0 nice! hope you enjoy your weekend and make sure to make the most out of it!
0.0 I really don't like randomly pumping into old friends, it get's me nervous, and i saw one of my old friend's today and  i was surprised, to say the least	1.0 yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about
0.0 yeah, so i tried to look for a way out before i admit defeat, but then i realised there was no way out and so i talked to them in the end	1.0 yeah a little chat to an old friend cannot hurt did you enjoy the conversation?
0.0 yeah it wasn't bad in the end, just awkward 	1.0 well im glad it did not go in the wrong direction
0.0 A co-worker of mine was fired at work	1.0 Do you think they deserved it?
0.0 No, their performance seemed to be good	1.0 Well as they say, "Better them than you"
0.0 Today my wife worked super hard for our future and made an amazing progress 	1.0 that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress
0.0 thank you, in a few months everything will work out perfectly	1.0 that is good hard work and determination will always pay off
0.0 today i was walking outside and then suddenly had a moment where i realised how amazing my life is	1.0 thats a really good feeling isnt it? anything in particular?
0.0 just how i have everything i ever wanted, and that made me feel very grateful 	1.0 Thats awesome.  Im glad youre happy.  keep the positive energy flowing
0.0 I got accused of something at work today.	1.0 Im guessing it wasnt your fault? Do you know whos it was?
0.0 I wasn't even at work the day it happened, yet they still insist it was me.	1.0 That sounds like sabotage to me. Is there any way to prove you werent there? I would be furious.
0.0 I watched out the window for visitors to my house today, it was saddening.	1.0 Did they not ever come?
0.0 No one came to visit.	1.0 Man that's a bummer.  I'd visit you but that would be weird.
0.0 today my wife and i decorated our house and made amazing designs on our bedroom walls, i am so proud of us 	1.0 That is awesome.  What kind of designs are there?
0.0 a rabbit near her and a owl near my side of the bed and random marks everywhere else	1.0 That is very very cool.  I would love something like that in mine
0.0 work was fun, my manager told everyone about the amazing work i put in	1.0 Its always nice getting praise and compliments.  I hope everyone was proud of you
0.0 they are, and i am very proud of myself	1.0 Thats great.  I hope you get a raise too
0.0 My dog was bit by something and had a huge front lip and looked really sad.  I felt terrible for him and was doing anything I could to help.	1.0 Like what?
0.0 I took him to the vet who checked it over and determined he was bit.  They suggested benedryl and rest for a couple days until it went down.	1.0 Wow that's really compassionate of you
0.0 I was looking though the window today and the beautiful sight outside the window gave me a positive outlook on life and made me realise to work harder for my future	1.0 Are you feeling much more motivated now? What do you want to achieve?
0.0 i am feeling motivated, i want to be financially free and continue to learn and develop myself even more	1.0 Thats such fantastic goals to aim for in life! I wish you all the best. 
0.0 It was my birthday today, so my family organised a party that I didn't know about.	1.0 Happy Birthday.  That was so nice of them.  I bet you were surprised.  Was there cake?
0.0 Oh yeah, the surprise was the cake being thrown in my face!	1.0 haha that sounds quite messy, but I hope that it atleast tasted good
0.0 money is such a weird thing, still don't agree with this ideology but it is the way things have been inherited since the start, i just wish it wasn't so controlling, i am worried about my future income  	1.0 I agree, you need money for everything these days and it controls us.
0.0 yeah i will continue to work hard on my finance and make sure it doesn't control me	1.0 Me too, I try not to worry about money so much. There's more to life than that.
0.0 my work is going well and i am happy with the outcome with everything and i am feeling hopeful	1.0 I hope your work continues on the path you want and expect.
0.0 thank you and i hope you do so too, let's work hard!	1.0 Hard work is supposed to payoff, right?
0.0 i am feeling very guilty recently as i am putting a lot of stress on my body and not sleeping enough, it's making me feel very bad	1.0 I know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast. Do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep.
0.0 i know i should, but it's been very rough recently with work and all	1.0 If you get sick you won't be able to work at all so please take care of yourself.
0.0 I won't listen to anyone anymore, what i know now is that i trust my guts! that always works out well for me 	1.0 What happened?
0.0 as usual i decided to listen to my father, he told me to come back to my home city and said he has a job there, so i could quit mine, but when i went there he lied, and now i don't have a job	1.0 Wow, that's cruel.
0.0 i anticipate my future, if i continue to work always and chase after my dreams i will climb that mountain  	1.0 Yeah that is a pretty good mindset to go by.
0.0 thank you, i hope it goes well for you too	1.0 Just keep it up and you will go far.
0.0 I believe in my abilities more now, i am surprised but today i managed to write amazing 3 line code to do the base 64 decode process	1.0 that is great! I'm also learning to write code.
0.0 oh really? what language on?	1.0 HTML/CSS/Java. I'm excited about a career change.
0.0 I was nervous for my mom's surprise party	1.0 why is that?
0.0 Not sure if everyone who RSVP'd would show up. People are so flaky these days.	1.0 oh god yes i know what you mean, any ideas what you wanna do ?
0.0 I decided to go a new route home from school today, but it didn't turn out as planned.	1.0 uhoh, did you get lost?
0.0 No, it just took me somewhere dodgy.	1.0 oh that is scary.  I hope you were ok.  make sure your doors are locked
0.0 I was able to get my car fixed	1.0 what was wrong with it
0.0 Engine issues, I'm praying it will last a bit longer now	1.0 good luck! we just had our mini cooper blow its engine yesterday .. $12.5k to replace 
0.0 today i listened to one of my old time favourite music and it moved my emotions and made me joyful	1.0 Well music does have a really cathartic effect on people.
0.0 yup, it's also a digital drug 	1.0 He can have a great impact on your brain and feeling that is for sure
0.0 oh god today! my friend stole my laptop as a prank and gave it back to me late at night 	1.0 Wow!  That's a horrible prank!  I would be crying!  What did you do when your friend gave it back?
0.0 i punched him, i was so mad and furious 	1.0 I would have been really mad as well!  Hopefully he learned not to pull that kind of prank on you again!
0.0 today is a weird day, i'm just feeling so emotional	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that. Do you mind if I ask what happened today to make it so weird?
0.0 it's not a bad feeling so dont be sorry, it happens every now and then, just makes me realise how grateful i am to be alive	1.0 Oh, I see. I think I kind of understand. It at least sounds like you're a really self-aware person, and appreciative of the small things, and that you have decent perspective on things. The emotions might be difficult to deal with, but at least there are some positives there for you to take stock of
0.0 I almost died today coming home from work.	1.0 thats crazy. and scary.  WHat happened?
0.0 Crashed the car, totalled it too.	1.0 im so sorry.  I hope youre ok
0.0 I'm so excited to get my paycheck in.	1.0 Getting paid is always a good thing. Were you waiting to get something special?
0.0 My boss said there might be the possibility of a raise this month.	1.0 You deserve one. Did you get it?
0.0 I was driving and someone cut me off in traffic	1.0 I hate it when that happens! Were they driving fast at the time, it could have been quite dangerous.
0.0 Not too fast, it was still irritating though	1.0 I can imagine, at least you got out of the situation safely
0.0 I picked up a 2nd job last year and today made my last student loan payment	1.0 That's awesome. I think it's great that you stepped up to repay your loans!
0.0 Yes, I'm so thankful it's done. It has taken me 15 years. Now only 15 more for my wife's loans	1.0 Oh man, well I hope that it was worth it to take out those loans.
0.0 I have lived alone for the last 10 years some day's I think I should get a dog.	1.0 That is such a long time to live in loneliness. I suggest you do, dogs are great companions
0.0 I was thinking I'll go to resume and adopt who ever has been their the longest.	1.0 Sounds like a great idea! That would be very nice of you to give a dog a home
0.0 Just found out my wife is pregnant	1.0 Wow, congratulations!!  Are you guys excited?

0.0 I moved to a town about 30-45 minutes away, but at that point we were so used to seeing each other every day of our lives.  It was hard to get used to.	1.0 I've moved almost half a dozen times in my life before, so I completely understand. Those were rough times.

0.0 My best friend has won those Taco Bell Playstation 4 giveaways twice so far.  I wish I could be that lucky sometimes.	1.0 Dang, and here I thought I was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest. Maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big?
0.0 I know, man just got together and buy like 50 boxes and cross our fingers.  And another thing was he got it on his first try both times.	1.0 Why stop at 50? We ought to get 100! We need to show your friend and evil corporate Taco Bell who is boss and nab us some consoles!

0.0 I was at the library today and was trying to study, but this lady across the table was smacking her gum very loud. 	1.0 Did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her?
0.0 well the library is very small so limited seats so I had to sit there and listen to it. I was so frusterated	1.0 That was very rude of her to do that, some people just have no manners.

0.0 I'm not trying to get arrested! I think I'll just wait things out until I move in two months.	1.0 I would go with the bigfoot option. You can get a costume on the cheap on ebay nowadays. I've used that tactic countless times and it has never failed!

0.0 She has been good so far. We are trying to limit her access to it to just a few hours per day. She also had to "turn it in" at night before she goes to bed.	1.0 That's great parenting! You have to trust that your children will make the right choices.

0.0 No. I just asked what it would cost to fix then told him I couldn't afford it to get him to leave. 	1.0 You made the right move. They at least have to show up with that giant truck that sucks the tank dry.
0.0 I bought a big bag of M&Ms and I could not resist it	1.0 If I had a bag of M&M's right now I would eat them for sure!
0.0 well that is what I just did, so far I have eaten half of it	1.0 maybe save the other half for later. lol.
0.0 I do not think I can and feel ashamed that I cannot resist it	1.0 That's ok, it happens to us all. Tomorrow is a new day.
0.0 I told my girlfriend about my self harm habits a little while ago.	1.0 How did she reacted to the admission to self harm? 
0.0 She was really sad, but she appreciated the fact that I told her. 	1.0 Now that your girlfriend knows the problem, the both of you can work on solutions and support together.
0.0 My friends wanted to bring me to laser quest for my birthday.	1.0 Is that like a laser tag place? That sounds like a lot of fun! What do you think?
0.0 Yeah exactly. I wasn't sure if I'd like it or not and I was a little unwilling to try it out. 	1.0 I've played laser tag a few times. I think you will have a great time! It's very high paced and noisy but that's half the fun.
0.0 I spent all of summer doing everything but studying for my final exam	1.0 Oh that sounds worrisome, do you think you will pass?
0.0 I'm fairly certain I'm going to fail and I feel awful about myself, but I just can't get myself to do it.	1.0 I'm sad to hear that but human nature is hard to fight. Honestly, if you have any alternative options or plans you may have to fall back on them.
0.0 My friends and I had spent all day troubleshooting a new PC build that we had just completed.	1.0 That sounds intensive! How did it go?
0.0 It went awful. It turned out that the motherboard or processor were defective and we had to deconstruct it to return both pieces. So much wasted time!	1.0 I bet that was so defeating! I'm sorry to hear that. I wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts.
0.0 It really was. At least my friend learned a lot about computers as we built it together!	1.0 That's a good bright side to look at.
0.0 I found an injured spider with a leg missing in my bathroom a few days ago.	1.0 Did you save it or kill it?
0.0 I saved it. I brought it outside and hoped for the best.	1.0 It's missing a leg so its probably dead unfortunately.
0.0 I passed two trials that a company put me through and I only have three left.	1.0 ooh, I bet you can't wait to finish!
0.0 You got that right! I'm feeling pretty happy about my performance and I think I'll get the job!	1.0 I hope you get it! Good luck!
0.0 I spent hours studying for a final exam.	1.0 How did they go? Did you pass?
0.0 It went amazing! I expected to pass but I didn't think I'd get a 91!	1.0 Wow! congrats, you should totally be proud of yourself.
0.0 I found an old stamp booklet my girlfriend and I filled out before we started dating.	1.0 That's very sweet! I bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you.
0.0  Definitely. I felt so warm and fuzzy on the inside, and so did she when I sent her a snapchat of it.	1.0 You guys sound like you have a solid relationship. It's always great to find those little pieces from the early days.
0.0 I'm pretty sure a girl at the convention was hitting on me.	1.0 Did you get her number?
0.0 Nah. I have a loving girlfriend and I would never cheat on her.	1.0 Good man, I have a lot of respect for that.
0.0 For my camping trip, I brought with me my tent, camping chairs, mattress, sleeping bag, pillows, med-kit, bug spray, food and beer.	1.0 That sounds like quite the checklist. I'm glad you brought the beer you might need it haha!
0.0 Oh yeah definitely. Never have I ever felt so ready for anything in my life.	1.0 Well I bet you're going to have a great time. With that haul I don't see how you couldn't!
0.0 I saw a man slap his dog on the sidewalk a few times while I was on the bus.	1.0 Holy cow! Did you call him in?
0.0 I should have, but last time my girlfriend did that the police ignored it. I was so angry.	1.0 Oh man!  Do you have a dog?
0.0 I just had to replace one of the window panes in my house.	1.0 How come? And was it a pain to replace it?
0.0 I'm not sure what happened.  I had to have a guy come out to replace it, and couldn't meet him, so my wife had to.	1.0 I hope he did a good job!
0.0 My said he did!  I had quite a bit of confidence in him, based on others' feedback.	1.0 Awesome, I'm glad to hear that. Sometimes it's hard to find contractors with good reputation.
0.0 When I was a kid, all my friends had Yu-Gi-Oh cards but me.	1.0 How come you didn't collect them? i loved them myself.
0.0 I think my parents found them expensive, otherwise I can't think of any other good reason. To be honest, I kind of envied my friends.	1.0 Well, they are expensive and you didn't really miss much.
0.0 I took up running and I started seeing a huge improvement in my cardiovascular endurance.	1.0 Nice, Was it hard to start?
0.0 Unimaginably hard. But once I got into it I couldn't stop. I'm feeling pretty certain that I'll hit my 5km goal in no time.	1.0 Wish i could run close to 5km, i'd struggle with 100 meters.
0.0 My younger brother was playing an old Gamecube game that I loved to play back when I was a kid.	1.0 That's cool. Man, those tiny disks were easy to lose. what game?
0.0 He was playing Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door. What an awesome game! It brought back so many great memories.	1.0 That's awesome. I get nostalgic about old games as well. 
0.0 My buddy drank way too much at a party and puked all over my favorite jacket.	1.0 That sounds horrible, Did you wash it or throw it away?
0.0 I washed it and it came out surprisingly. But at that time, I felt so sick seeing what was happening to my jacket that I thought I was going to puke next.	1.0 That is a really rough story, You should make him pay for another one.
0.0 A few months ago, a good friend of mine that I look up to attempted suicide.	1.0 damn, is he ok now?
0.0 Thankfully he is. He's doing much better, but the thought still shakes me scared to this day.	1.0 Did he go to the doctors for help? anyway i'm glad he is OK.
0.0 I drank too much and passed out a few months ago. 	1.0 Oh no! Was it a fun night? 
0.0 It was, but it got scary at some point. Apparently people were trying to wake me up by shaking me and I would not get up.	1.0 Oh heck! That had to be really scary for them! glad you're okay though! 
0.0 I was packing up my house to move, and found my old yearbooks! It's so weird to look back and see how far everyone I knew in high school has come.	1.0 Aww, that sounds interesting!  Are you in touch with many people from high school?
0.0 A couple people. Fewer as the years go by, unfortunately. 	1.0 I get that.  It's weird when I forget the name of someone I knew for years.
0.0 My brother went on a low-calorie diet and began shaking everyday.	1.0 Poor thing!  Is he felling better now?  I hope he quit that diet.
0.0 He quit the diet a while ago as recommended by his doctor. I was a little scared but I knew it was just side effects of a bad diet.	1.0 Thank god he is ok.  There are very dangerous diets around, better be guided by his doctor.
0.0 I let my brother drive my car for the first time yesterday.	1.0 Were you nervous?
0.0 No, he's such a good driver. I knew I had nothing to worry about.	1.0 That's awesome.  I'm glad he did so well.
0.0 Last week I woke up to a really cute text from my girlfriend and a funny message from my brother.	1.0 That's lovely! I love waking up to awesome texts.
0.0 Yeah! I had a moment of realizing how lucky I am to be in the position I find myself in, and felt really thankful for my life and the people a part of it.	1.0 That's so wonderful to hear.
0.0 My girlfriend spent a few days in the woods with no cellular service with her parents.	1.0 How did that make you feel?
0.0 Really lonesome. I missed her so much.	1.0 I bet. I'm not great at being away from my boyfriend.
0.0 Ever since I've been on these anti anxiety and depression medication, I've been able to socialize a lot more.	1.0 That's great! What have you been doing to socialize?
0.0 Just talking to more people in general. For example, at a convention I was volunteering at. 	1.0 What kind of convention?
0.0 I volunteer at a dog shelter every weekend.	1.0 That's such a sweet thing to do.
0.0 Thank you, they're so cute!	1.0 Dogs are probably my favorite pet. Maybe I should take up volunteering for a dog shelter one day.
0.0 I'm still upset over Lil Peep's death.	1.0 Lil Peep died? when.
0.0 November of 2017. Almost a year ago. 	1.0 damn, him and XXXtentacion we're really good.
0.0 My dog sheds so much I have to vacuum my room practically every 4 days if I don't want little tufts of fur everywhere.	1.0 I love puppies! But they definitely are a lot of work in terms of their hair.
0.0 You're right. I'm just so irritated, even if it isn't his fault and I love the big goof.	1.0 I understand. Our puppy sheds a ton too and he isnt even that hairy of a dog
0.0 My brother and a bunch of our friends planned to go to a 15-person cottage in July.	1.0 Oh my, that sounds like an absolute blast!
0.0 It was. At that time, I couldn't wait for all the fun and games we would experience!	1.0 Did you stay for long? That would be a great vacation. 
0.0 We stayed for only 4 days because it cost us about $200 each for four days and nights, but I hope we can book it for a whole week or two next summer.	1.0 What a great time! Is the cottage on a lake?
0.0 It's very close to a lake, it probably takes a two minute hike down through a patch of trees and tall grass to get there.	1.0 Sounds like heaven!
0.0 One time when I was in Kindergarten, I needed to go to the restroom. The teacher did not let me, so I peed myself	1.0 Oh no! Did you get in trouble?
0.0 Yes, they called my parents and I was sent home. I got spanked	1.0 Aww, I'm sorry. Hope that teacher learned a lesson 
0.0 Last month I went on vacation and had to find someone to cat sit. It was a relief to find someone that I could trust to come by each day and not forget.	1.0 It's wonderful peace of mind to find someone you can trust with your fur babies! Did you have a nice trip?
0.0 Yes, I was able to go visit my stepdaughter on the other side of the country. The sitter sent pictures occasionally, so I didn't spend my trip worrying.	1.0 Aw, that was so nice! I'd love to find a cat sitter like that!
0.0 My son had his 4th birthday a couple of weeks ago.	1.0 How did it go? What'd you get him for a gift?
0.0 He got a remote control excavator, and had a lot of fun at his party.  It's crazy how fast he's growing up, though.	1.0 It seems like all those years just flew by, huh. At least now he's getting old enough to start remembering all these great times!
0.0 It's really hard to get motivated on Fridays.	1.0 Are you feeling zapped from the week?
0.0 Yeah, there's a lot going on.  I ended up heading to work anyway.	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you don't have to work through the weekend!
0.0 No, I don't have to.  But there's plenty of work to do on our house!	1.0 It never ends does it? I hope you keep your head above water though, it's all you got sometimes!
0.0 I bought a bunch of dumbbells, and a workout bench but I've barely used them.	1.0 I feel that pain. Do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do?
0.0 I don't have the motivation. I know the workouts I should be doing but also struggle with proper form a bit.	1.0 I get that. Well if I could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything. Dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage.
0.0 Thanks for the advice!	1.0 Sure. I love working out. 
0.0 i have a impacted wisdom tooth. I need to go to the dentist but I am apprehensive about it.	1.0 How much pain are you on a scale of 1-10?
0.0 on bad days it is about a 6	1.0 Dang that sounds bad! I know you might be frightened of going but I think you should go. You'll be better off for it.
0.0 A few years ago, I was invited to Rockfest by my older brother and his friends.	1.0 That was nice of them! I bet you felt really cool hanging with them. How did it go?
0.0 Yeah it was awesome! I was a little scared at first but within a few hours of arriving there it turned into a total blast!	1.0 That is awesome! I love festivals, they're always great to unwind and even just walk around talking to people.
0.0 "I haven't been following my healthy eating regiment as strictly as I should.	1.0 Why not, have you have many temptations?  I know how difficult it can be at times to eat healthy, I struggle to do it too.
0.0 Yeah. Carbs like pasta and bread get me every time. 	1.0 I know, fresh bread is a big temptation to me, and what about sweets and desserts, do you have a weakness for those too?
0.0 I told my best friends about my suicidal thoughts.	1.0 It's really a good start to recognized that you should talk about it. We all need someone to just listen once in awhile.
0.0 Yeah you're right. I had faith in them and they ended up being really supportive.	1.0 Oh that's a good friend. I hope your feeling better now.
0.0 One time I thought about getting Dominoes Pizza, but then I remembered I was loyal to Pizza Hut	1.0 I like dominos better
0.0 It tastes pretty good now, but I still like the oily goodness of Pizza Hut!	1.0 Dominoes, IMO, has better prices and better pizza. I dont like all that oil
0.0 One time my mom brought me lunch all the way from the restaurant where she works!	1.0 That's thoughtful of her. Nice to know that your mom was thinking of you in the middle of the day.
0.0 Yup, she is the best! I shall make it up to her one day!	1.0 Take her out to dinner! That would be a treat.
0.0 One time I was at the grocery store and I accidentally walked out with a item without paying for it	1.0 Oh no! You must've felt ashamed. did you return it?
0.0 Yes, I got caught and had to walk back in shame!	1.0 Hopefully they were understanding that it was accidental?
0.0 I was very late to work today and they were so busy with patients.	1.0 Did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their.
0.0 Well I will find out tomorrow. I know better than that is what she told me, especially on Fridays, when we are the busiest. 	1.0 Its always best to be on time , I hope they understand no one is perfect.
0.0 My boss told me to go to school to become a doctor instead of a nurse. I felt like it was a compliment. Im worried about how much and how long medical school will take.	1.0 The journey there is always the toughest, its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it
0.0 I agree. I guess I will weigh my options, its just im getting old and watn to start a family too, so I dont know.	1.0 With whatever you decide in life just know that you are a very skilled and intelligent person! Im sure you will find your path in life eventually with time
0.0 My friend and I got in an argument about religion today. It made me question my faith. 	1.0 Wow, that was serious then
0.0 Yeah. I want to stay true to my beliefs, but she made some very valid points. 	1.0 OK, so what is your plan now? 
0.0 I remember back when I started college. I moved to a new state where I didn't know anyone and I had no idea what to expect.	1.0 Wow that sounds scary. Did you make good friends?
0.0 Yes, I did eventually. There's something to be said for living in a dorm at a time when you want to meet new people and fit in.	1.0 Yes it can be really helpful! I went to school 3 hours from my home and it was still hard to meet new people
0.0 Today I had to tell a patient about her lab results. Come to find out she could not have babies. She was very upset.	1.0 Oh, that must have been a hard thing to do. I'd hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news...
0.0 Yeah I felt bad. She started crying so much. Its like her world ended there.	1.0 So sad...that makes me want to cry, too, just hearing about her reaction.
0.0 Whenever I go back to my hometown I love driving by the house I grew up in. I have such great memories.	1.0 I bet it does! Do you go by there often?
0.0 I get to visit about once a year. I always wish that I knew who lived there now so I could see the inside of the house.	1.0 I bet it's much different than it was back when you lived there.
0.0 I found out some bad news the other day.	1.0 Oh no :( Can you tell me? It's okay if it's too private.
0.0 I just got back my grade for my final for my class and I failed it. I studied real hard, but unfortunately it didn't seem to matter.	1.0 Oh my gosh I'm so sorry that really sucks. :( Can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong?
0.0 I'm going to have to at least try. Maybe they'll be understanding and let me attempt again.	1.0 Good luck to you! I wish you all the best <3
0.0 Someone twisted what I Said earlier today to make it seem like i was saying something else. I felt reall ybad.	1.0 Oh no why would they do such a thing
0.0 They were angry and wanted to be aggressive. 	1.0 Definitely doesn't excuse what they did.
0.0 Some lady I know tried to hit on me even though she very well knew I am in a relationship!	1.0 That's not cool. I bet it felt awkward.
0.0 It really did but I would never do something to jeopardize my relationship.	1.0 You are a stand up person!
0.0 I had a nice quiet evening at home tonight.	1.0 Nice, silence is golden
0.0 Well, my family was here, too.  Toddlers don't make life quiet, but they make me feel fulfilled.	1.0 Full of what?
0.0 There was a meeting scheduled today that I thought was utterly pointless.	1.0 Oh no, was it one of those meetings that should have been an email?
0.0 It definitely was, so I ended up skipping it.	1.0 Hopefully you don't get in trouble but I definitely know the feeling. 
0.0 I told my close friend a very big secret yesterday.	1.0 Oh really, were you supposed to tell them?
0.0 It was my choice. I really don't think they'll tell anyone! They're good people.	1.0 You can never be to sure now a days, they might post your secret to social media.
0.0 One time I was really sure that I was going to ace a test because I studied all night	1.0 Did you ace your test?
0.0 Yup, I was worried during the test too, but I am glad everything turned out okay	1.0 I always worry when I have to take tests. Unfortunately, I am horrible with tests. I am glad you aced it!
0.0 A friend at work recently got a raise.  That's the 2nd one in the last year for him!	1.0 Nice, what a legend and a gentleman
0.0 Yeah, but I haven't had one in 3 years.	1.0 Word, you should ask him what the secret is
0.0 I was totally committed to him in every way I could be.   HOwever he ended up cheating on me	1.0 That kind of cold disregard for someone you're supposed to love is totally alien to me, the guilt would destroy me.
0.0 It would me too, not only that but he just up and got with her like I never existed to him.   Its funny because he always accused me of cheating on him and I had no clue why.  It was him the whole time!	1.0 Yeah Freud called it Projection, it's too bad people tend to hide their true natures so well.
0.0 He kept doing drugs, and taking things that didnt belong to him.  It broke my heart but I didnt know what else to do.	1.0 It's awful! I know so many families are dealing with similar situation. Sometimes we don't know how to help someone close to us. Heart breaking...
0.0 Yes you are right about that.  I dealt with it for a long time and then I just couldn't anymore.  Over and over things would disappear and he would of course always deny it.  He became violent at time to his sister and me and I couldn't put them at risk.	1.0 You can't help him until he wants to really change. Sometimes all you can do is pray.
0.0 today after coming back from work i saw my wife and she was asking me why are you late with questioning eyes, i told her that i wen't to go and get her favourite meal, i felt so faithful 	1.0 Did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done?
0.0 she was joking about it, but she was so happy afterwards and we ate together, it was such a nice day	1.0 It's good to get to spend time with those you love. I am happy for you.
0.0 after a long day from work, i was stuck at this math problem, but then i decided to go for a walk instead of working on the problem, i trust my guts, after i had come back from the walk, the solution kicked in and i was able to do the problem	1.0 That's inspiring, has that worked for you in the past in the same way?
0.0 yes always, it is something that works for me	1.0 That's so cool, you seem very intuitive
0.0 it was 3am, i was walking at the utter night... i was scared out of my mind... anything could happen, my walking speed increased... and everything i was seeing suddenly became more and more scary	1.0 That sounds frightening. Did you get home safely?
0.0 in the end yes.. but the journey was sure hell	1.0 Why were you walking so late at night?
0.0 today i realised the small details of my life and i feel more satisfied	1.0 Nice, what are some things you realized?
0.0 that i have everything i wished for.	1.0 You don't have me yet <3
0.0 One time I bought water and snacks before a hurricane came to wreck my city	1.0 oh god, how did you . have the courage to even go outside?
0.0 My house flooded so I had to get on my roof !	1.0 that sounds like an adventurous day 
0.0 One time they put cheese in my hamburger when I told them not to!	1.0 Wow, how could they do that?
0.0 They are complete monsters I tell ya!	1.0 Someone's gotta put an end to that poor service!
0.0 i lied to my mother and i feel very uneasy	1.0 You should. No matter what you can't lie to your Mom. It will always come back on you.
0.0 i just realised this now	1.0 Come clean and fix it. It will make you feel better.
0.0 i am beginning to realise in my abilities and i feel so confident in them, i am able to anything	1.0 Nice! Do you have any superpowers?
0.0 In a way yes, yes i do the power of my will and mind	1.0 I like your confidence! Fighting!
0.0 When I drink coffee, memories from my past keep playing in my head	1.0 oh nice, what kind of memories?
0.0 Memories of talking to strangers in chatroom. Lots of things 	1.0 how does this make you feel like?
0.0 I have been working on my programming skills and I feel like I can get a new job now!	1.0 That's awesome! You're going to be rolling in the dough with those skills
0.0 Hell yeah, no more living in mom's basement!	1.0 That's exciting. How long have you been learning programming?
0.0 From time to time I see an older man around our town driving his lawn mower from place to place..  SOmetimes I see him at  McDonalds, or the Dollar General Store.  	1.0 an interesting one, what does this make you feel ?
0.0 Well at first I thought it was cute until I saw him at the gas station the other day.  I overheard him asking someone that was getting gas if he happened to have a little change he could have.  He needed to get home in his lawnmower but didn't have the money to do so.   I ended up giving him 3 bucks.	1.0 oh did he say anything afterwards? what happend next?
0.0 i believe i am a really caring person, because i always take care of cats and feed them and lately they are more and more close to me	1.0 That is so kind of you, I also a have a soft heart for animals.  I happen to be a dog person, but I do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends.  
0.0 i am a both person ahaha i also have a dog, but he is always so mean 	1.0 I can't say I have had any mean dogs as of yet.  My favorite breed is  a pitbull.   THey are so loyal  and sweet although  lots of people claim they are mean and vicious .
0.0 towels, clothes, underwear and phone all checked! and ready for my holiday #feelingsoprepeared	1.0 where are you going!
0.0 TO SEE MY BABY GIRL	1.0 thats awesome i hope you have a good time with her
0.0 One time I bought a scratch lottery ticket and I didn't win anything!	1.0 Wow, that must've been disappointing.
0.0 Yes, I was off by one number. I was going to be a millionaire!	1.0 Oh! So close. Just to think about that missed opportunity.
0.0 every day the weather makes me feel so nostalgic, the colors, the wind all bring back a certain memory from my past	1.0 Yeah, it's like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same
0.0 yes! i am so glad you get it, it's beautiful but also sad at the same time	1.0 Yup, and I feel there's a part of us that is eternal as well
0.0 One time I went into the public restroom and saw poop smeared everywhere! Ew!	1.0 I think I would leave if I saw something like that.
0.0 I left as fast as possible!	1.0 Did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it?
0.0 Nope, just you!	1.0 It seems most responsible to alert someone to clean it.
0.0 One time I was so nervous to look at my grade for my final exam	1.0 I feel that way sometimes when I check my bank account, how's school going?
0.0 I failed and dropped out! Now I live in my parents house doing nothing all day	1.0 Word, college is tough, wishing you the best
0.0 like who on earth writes var int value = 1, this is so ridiculous i am so annoyed at my brother, after everything i tought him, he doesn't even know the basics 	1.0  and got upset with you?
0.0 no i was the one who was upset with him	1.0  And why do not you try to teach your brother?
0.0 i am working so hard, that i can see a pile of money building up for my future 	1.0 Good for you!  I hope it does not stress you out, though.
0.0 it doesn't i am taking regular breaks	1.0 That is good.  Money is no good if you are not healthy enough to enjoy it.
0.0 One time I saw a creepy person run towards me in the night out in the streets	1.0 Dang, how fast did you run away?
0.0 I froze up because I was terrified. It was just my brother though	1.0 Did you tell him how creepy he is lol
0.0 While I was packing my stuff to move, I found Old high school pictures. It made me think of all the good times  I had.	1.0 That is awesome, what types of photos did you find? Anything funny or silly? 
0.0 Well more of my old best friend. I have not seen her i a long time.We went through alot together. It was nostalgic to me. 	1.0 Aww yeah, those are great times that you can never really go back to. Sometimes I also wish I could go back in time...maybe you could call her up again and catch up on the last few years! 
0.0 being alive is so much stress and anxiety, why does it have to be like this? why can't we just all express our individual selves, instead we are forced to work so that we can eat 	1.0 It's not fair, eh. Having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself. At least it's comforting know that most everyone feels the same? 
0.0 Yes, it's true we all know this inside out, but we still continue to work on our meaningless lives, the funny thing is we all know but no one is acting, if we all acted we would be living in a much more beautiful and free life, not one which just gives the impression of freedom, that's all there is now, faking but i guess the one thing that is true is my feelings	1.0 Maybe if we weren't so attached to being creatures of comfort. Some things we just can't let go of, wouldn't exist without some poor shmuck having to do the dirty work. I guess we're all that shmuck to someone, someway or another.
0.0 I watched a movie the other night that really got me in my feelings.	1.0 Oh wow, what ovie was it and how did it make you feel? 
0.0 I don't remember the name. I was watching it with a friend and they put it on but it was about a son who found his birth mother after many years apart.	1.0 oh wow that sounds very emotional, I think I would have needed a bucket to catch all my tears. 
0.0 i am so disappointed in myself, i could have do so much better at work but i guess it wasn't my day, i was not able to focus	1.0 I liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me
0.0 what makes you so sure? anything can happen i mean just look at murphy's law 	1.0 May be you are right. But sometimes, you go with your heart not with the law. Murphy's law may not work in every situation.
0.0 My grandma ended up getting really sick this last week.	1.0 Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. How is she doing and how are you holding up? 
0.0 She is getting much better. My family and I did everything we could to take care of her.	1.0 That is great that she has such a great support group and loving family members to support her. I hope she gets well soon! :)
0.0 i feel so guilty, my sister crying because 'someone eat her cake' that she had been saving for 2 days now, and that someone was non other than me...	1.0 Oh no, maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her!
0.0 oh wow you are such a genius! why didn't i think of that before... there is always a bright side to everything	1.0 Yes there is! Maybe throw in a cupcake too, I am sure she will forgive you in a heart beat! I know I would. :) 
0.0 words cannot describe how happy i am, in 2 weeks time i will go and see my wife i am so joyful and exciting 	1.0 I am so happy for you! Why have you been apart for the past two weeks?
0.0 no we live in a long distance relationship (not for long though) so it's hard for me to see her, but i will be able to see her after 6 months apart  	1.0 Awesome to hear that you'll get to live with your loved one soon
0.0 I had a terrible experience at the grocery store today.	1.0 Oh no what happened, are you alright? 
0.0 Yeah, I'm alright. But I dropped a jar of pasta sauce and it ended up shattering. Sauce got all over the floor.	1.0 Oh no that must have been a terrible experience, I hope no one got hurt from the shattered glass.
0.0 I aced all my classes this semester, so Im hoping and thinking my GPA will be a 4.0	1.0 That's what I like to hear! What changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible 4.0?
0.0 I actually gave more effort this semester, so I will continue to do goo and hope to get into nursing school next year.	1.0 wow. that's awesome! you'll need  that work ethic in nursing school for sure.
0.0 So everything for a party im throwing this weekend is ready and everything is paid for. I have it ready last week so I wouldnt stress.	1.0 It sounds like you're quite the organized person!
0.0 Yea. I like to have things ready and done prior to make sure everything goes well.	1.0 I'm the same way a lot of the time. It's really a good way to avoid any unnecessary disasters.
0.0 Im going to ask my girlfriend to marry me this weekend! I have no doubt in my mind she will say no	1.0 That is so exciting! Best of luck to you man! I doubt she would reject such a great guy like you. :) 
0.0 Thanks! I think we are doing well so i wont be disappointed or sidetracked by a no from her.	1.0 That is great, I would also be surprised if she said no to a man like you! 
0.0 i am so afraid... afraid that i am not giving too much to the world, what if i parish not having done anything?	1.0 I wouldn't worry too much about it. None of it really matters, if we make a difference or not, we all end up dust in the end.
0.0 no, i don't believe that, whether you are having a bad day or not if you look at everything clearly you will see there is a next stage, just like birth death is a process	1.0 If telling yourself that makes you feel better, I found all of that to be much more stressful. To be completely honest with you I think people invented stories about the after life to make them more comfortable with death.
0.0 the world is such a disgusting place now, i wish i was born back in the 70s 	1.0 Yeah, 70s were incredible, the dancing the cars, the women had style and the music was incredible.
0.0 RIGHT?! but now is just so bad, i wish i could go back	1.0 But we got to make the best of it, pretty soon elon musk will release flying cars and then life will be amazing again.
0.0 today everyone said congratulations to me, as i succeed in making an amazing app, and now i am so greatful to be alive! 	1.0 Congratulations on your success! I bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals.
0.0 thank you! it's always nice to tell you these things, you don't get jealous and you are just happy for me, thank you	1.0 There will always be people that are jealous of your success, but it is up to you to be the bigger person and handle it with grace.
0.0 I came home from work today to a disaster. My dog chewed up the new couch i just purchased.	1.0 Oh no, can you return it or get a refund?
0.0 No I didnt purchase insurance. When i saw it my blood was boiling!	1.0 I am sorry to hear that, I would have felt the same way. 
0.0 I gave my dog away to a family today. I did not have time for him since work and school take alot of it up.	1.0 That has got to be rough. At least it has a home now that hopefully has more time.
0.0 I agree, but im praying they will take care of him. hes just a puppy.	1.0 I'm sure they will be great to him and he'll bring them joy as well!
0.0 I saw my girlfriend getting real friendly with another guy at the bar last night	1.0 OH no! Are you the jealous type?
0.0 It definitely had me feeling a little uneasy about the whole situation.	1.0 OH man! Yeah I would of felt the same way!
0.0 I have a test coming up next week.	1.0 oh no do you feel ready for it? 
0.0 I'm super ready for it! I spent so much time studying over the last week.	1.0 That is great, I believe that you will do amazing! 
0.0 I AM SO ANNOYED! i have been trying to solve this math problem for 2 hours now	1.0 Oh that sounds really annoying. maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help?
0.0 there isn't any solution it's a century award i am working on, it's the problem of non-polynomial descent 	1.0 Oh I see, well good luck to you, I hope you'll solve it soon.
0.0 I'm really feeling alright about how my life is going right now.	1.0 That is great, what has been going on in your life recently?
0.0 I've just been getting things done. Nothing has been going amazing but nothing really sucks either.	1.0 That is good, sometimes that is all you really need to do, get things done  one step at a time :) 
0.0 The ads for the new World Of Warcraft expansion really makes me think about when I played it many years ago.	1.0 They looked really exciting! Does it make you want to play it again?
0.0 It does. I put so much time in that game before. I might have to pick it up again.	1.0 If it makes you happy then you should do it! Capitalize on that nostalgic feeling while you can.
0.0 I woke up to something super annoying this morning.	1.0 That is always frustrating. What happened?
0.0 I woke up to find out my car was sideswiped while it was parked by the curb during the night. No note or anything.	1.0 Wow, some people are just terrible! I hate when people don't take responsibility for their actions.
0.0 I'm really disappointed in my son's actions that I was told about.	1.0 What did he do?
0.0 He got caught cheating by his teacher on a test the other day.	1.0 Oh no. What do you think caused him to do that?
0.0 I ate such a disgusting thing the other day by accident.	1.0 What was it that you accidentally ate?
0.0 I bought a sandwich and after a few bite I noticed that there was a bunch of mold.	1.0 Eww that sounds horrible! Were you able to get a refund at least?
0.0 I recently had my first child.  I was absolutely terrified when I went into labour but I put all my faith in the wonderful midwives and everything worked out perfectly!	1.0 I'm glad it went as planned. I can imagine that to be a very stressful moment.
0.0 it really was its just so scary but I had to believe the experience and caring nature of the midwives would get my through it and it did.  I really admire anyone in that career, its not just a job but a vocation.	1.0 You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody, I agree.
0.0 I started a diet today and just as soon as I get home I eat a burger!	1.0 I know how hard diets are to stick to. What foods are you avoiding?
0.0 Fried foods. I feel bad I didn't commit to it the first day. 	1.0 Don't be too hard on yourself, it's hard to quit something immediately. Just keep trying, I believe in you!
0.0 Thank you! I need that motivation so I can get over this shame im feeling. 	1.0 I get it. There is always another meal to start making the change!
0.0 I'm so not looking forward to tomorrow.	1.0 Why not? What happens tomorrow?
0.0 I have to talk to a large group at work tomorrow. 	1.0 Don't let it worry you too much. Just make sure you organize everything you need to present and remember to speak loudly and clearly! You can do it!
0.0 I changed my shift to overnight and walking to my care gave me the creeps tonight. There was a man standing in the dark.	1.0 That sounds creepy! Is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car? There is strength in numbers!
0.0 I agree. I had goosbumps all over and chills down my spine. 	1.0 I definitely recommend getting some mace and a pocket knife. Stay safe out there!
0.0 My brother is going into surgery tomorrow.	1.0 I hope that all goes well. I am sure he will be good as new after!
0.0 I'm really hoping so! I've been really worried.	1.0 I am sure the procedure will go excellently.
0.0 Today my friend had all of is awe, becasue she won the singing contest at work. She is so shy and no one would have ever known she could sing. 	1.0 That's really cool! I bet people really underestimated that underdog!
0.0 I agree! I was amazed with her performance. She did really well.	1.0 That's awesome! Maybe she'll come out of her shell.
0.0 I have such a fear of flying, so you can just imagine how I felt when my husband bought us a sky diving voucher for my 30th birthday! He was so excited and I was so nervous and uneasy.	1.0 He's a brave man. How was the experience?
0.0 Well the day came and off we travelled.  We arrived at the place only to find all our friends and family there to cheer us on.  Up we went in the plane and of course while the lovely instructors tried to reassure me the whole time, i tried desperately to keep my breakfast down!  However after the nerves and initial panic when we jumped out, it was actually one of the most amazing experiences of my life!	1.0 It sounds incredible! Hopefully it helped you conquer your fear!
0.0 I was so worried that I could not pay for my tuition this semester. Thankfully my boss decided to give us a big bonus. 	1.0 Congratulations! Worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic!
0.0 Yeah and its the last one before I graduate! I can be more thankful for his generosity. 	1.0 You're going to kill it this semester! You're going to be so proud when you're walking down the aisle to get handed your degree.
0.0 I was doing a big clear out recently and stumbled accross my old high school year book.  It is a long time since I left school and couldnt believe I even still had it.  Such a feeling of nostalgia looking at the old photos and reading the stories.	1.0 Did you guys write still write notes in each others' books in high school?
0.0 Yes!  I laughed and sometimes cried a bit reading through those, especially from some old friends that are no longer with here.  It even brought up some great memories of prom and our school leaving party.	1.0 It's amazing how many feelings and memories mementos like that can bring back.
0.0 So i just bought a brand new corvette and I let my friend barrow it to go out of town. 	1.0 That's awesome! Hopefully it comes back in one piece.
0.0 I agree! She will take care of it. I have faith she will bring it back the way she got it! lol	1.0 I think it will be fine. I bet the new car runs well.
0.0 My husband wont be back for a month due to work and Im here at the house by myself.	1.0 Im sure that is tough.  You must really miss him.
0.0 Yeah i have no pets or children so im just here in an empty house. 	1.0 Do you get nervous being on your own?
0.0 Nah just bored. Im new to this city so I dont know anybody either. 	1.0 Oh that sounds even tougher.  It is a long time but I hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again.
0.0 Yea I agree! II feel so helpless being home by myself. 	1.0 Im sure your not though! 
0.0 I had the worst experience last weekend.  I woke up to find someone had stolen my car! I was in absolute shock just couldnt believe it.	1.0 Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?
0.0 Well yes.  While i was in my daze, absolutely horrified, my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.	1.0 Yeah i would have felt the same way. 
0.0 Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!	1.0 yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.
0.0 Today after a long day at work I sat in traffic for 2 hours due to construction on the freeway!	1.0 That's a ton of traffic. I hope they finish their project soon
0.0 Me too! I get so frusterated because there are no back roads to my house so I have to go through this for the next 2 weeks. 	1.0 That's unfortunate. I wish we could fly sometimes.
0.0 My old friend suprised me with a phone call today. I have not heard from her since high school. 	1.0 How lovely!  I such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together.
0.0 Yes it was. I cant wait for our reunion so we can catch up on more!	1.0 That is a brilliant idea.  There is nothing better than catching up with old friends.
0.0 A little stray pup appeared on my driveway yesterday.  My initial reaction was to contact the local pet shelter.  However no one had reported him.  I decided to take him in, wash him and feed him.  I have never been much of an animal person but I couldnt believe how much i felt for this poor wee puppy.	1.0 Awe your such a caring and loving person! Are you going to keep it?
0.0 I didnt think I was but he has won my heart.  No one claimed him, even after posters being put around so yes he has officially become part of the family.  To be honest I was glad no owner came forward, I would never have wanted to give him up in the end he has just stolen my heart!	1.0 The love and care you show him will bring him joy and happiness! 
0.0 I got super wasted. I accidentally messed myself in front of people	1.0 Oh wow, that must've been a hard situation. Especially later when you were more in control again.
0.0 Yeah. That was the day I decided to no longer drink	1.0 That sounds like a good decision. Good luck!
0.0 I'm really excited for this next weekend!	1.0 What's happening this weekend? I hope you have some good things planned.
0.0 A friend that has been living overseas for the last year or so is going to come back to visit finally!	1.0 That's awesome! I'm very excited for you this is a good event for you!
0.0 I had a really scary experience the other day.	1.0 That's interesting. Are you okay?
0.0 Yeah, I'm fine. My friend got into a car crash while I was in the car though.	1.0 That's bad news. I hope that everyone is healthy and doing well.
0.0 I went camping the other day and had a rlly bad experience during it.	1.0 Why what happened?
0.0 I ended up getting lost for a bit in the woods which was not fun. Luckily, I made it back to my group at some point.	1.0 Oh sounds scary!  I would have been scared.
0.0 When I was a teenager I used to borrow my big sisters clothes without her knowledge.  One time she had just bought a lovely new dress after saving all her wages.  That weekend I borrowed it and of course ripped it!  The next day when she found out she was so angry and i felt terrible.	1.0 Oh no! I hope she's forgiven you since then.
0.0 oh yes she has, it was a while ago now but at the time the guilt was awful.  Needless to say I learnt my lesson and never borrowed her clothes again!	1.0 That's probably a good idea.
0.0 My last day of work was yesterday. I got so emotional driving home and I cried.	1.0 I'm sorry to hear you were upset! Why did you have to quit?
0.0 Im going back to school full time. I was there for more than 10 years. I will miss everyone. 	1.0 Wow that is a long time! Hopefully you can stay in touch with all of your former coworkers.
0.0 Yesterday I found my boyfriend with someone else!	1.0 hmmn, really?..i guess you must have felt very bad
0.0 I was gonna explode. Im so fed up with him. Im so done.	1.0 am so sorry about that, did he apologize?
0.0 One time when I was younger I wore a Halloween costume that I'd been looking forward to show off.  But I ended up covering myself up with a cape, because I was self conscious of how I looked.	1.0 Aww- I'm sorry that happened. Why were you embarrassed?
0.0 Well the costume itself ended up looking great, since my mom made it.  But I hadn't realized how fat I looked when i wore it, so I felt bad.	1.0 It's always difficult when you feel self-conscious - but I've learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself. 
0.0 That's true, but no matter how much I tell myself that I always end up thinking about it too much about it.  I'm constantly worrying about what people think of me.	1.0 Please try to be kinder to yourself! You are a great person- with a lot to offer. Always remember to be good to yourself.
0.0 Whom do you belive the most	1.0 In reference to what?
0.0 Your trustful person?	1.0 My husband is my most trusted companion.
0.0 my father couldn't stope any lower, how can someone take money from their own child	1.0 That's horrible! I'm a parent and I could never take money from my child. Did you confront him?
0.0 i did many times, but he threatens to kick me out and ruin everything	1.0 How frustrating! Keep your head held high and be strong. One day you'll be able to keep him from taking your money.
0.0 my wife is always there for me, so i trust her more than anybody and i dont want to have any friends otehr than her, she is my faith	1.0 That's really nice, however, to keep the marriage fresh and strong, I think it's important for you to have outside friends.
0.0 that's only normie talk, we are both introverted and we hate people	1.0 Haha, well I do know the feeling. I guess if it works for you, then don't change anything.
0.0 i am a joke, i am ashemed of what i did	1.0 what did you do???
0.0 i builied someone because they made fun of my mother, but the person had difficulties walking already and i buillied i can't believe i did that	1.0 well im sure you'll get over it. nobody should make fun of our mothers
0.0 I  waited 3 years for them to realise season 3 and they promised it was to be released today, i was so devastated when i found out that they had to postpone it even more :/ it's just so annoying	1.0 stay hopeful! , they'll release it sooner or later
0.0 i hope so :<	1.0 it's all gonna be fine and you'll get what u want.
0.0 I still have a favorite stuffed animal of mine that I've had since I was young.  It's still in pretty good condition and reminds me a lot of my childhood.	1.0 That is so sweet. It is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories. 
0.0 Yeah, it is.  I always like to keep things that mean a lot to me and this was a gift from my mom so it's even more special.	1.0 That really does make it special. I'm glad you have that. 
0.0 a young girl, crying, sadden by the cruelity of our elders, told me about all these feelings i began to cry and became very sentimental	1.0 ....what feelings? what are you talking about
0.0 she said that the elder man approached her and told her she is dumb and that made her very sad and upset	1.0 oh man, that's rough to hear from someone older than you. is she ok?
0.0 i am so envious of my sister, she has everything i just want to make her life hell	1.0 That doesn't sound very good, but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with
0.0 yeah but only i should get everything! no one else	1.0 Other people deserve to have things, too.
0.0 i am so embaressed at myself... i cant believe i fell down the stairs and my pants fell and my behind was exposed to the whole crowd 	1.0 Oh no! When that happens you have to get up and yell, "Safe!"
0.0 indeed, but this time i was red and yelling in my head	1.0 Awww, well it happens to everyone sometimes. Just try to forget it. 
0.0 don't you think life is peaceful? are you content?	1.0 eh not really. what about you
0.0 i did, espcially today when i woke up, i realised how everything is meaningful and how i can't just waste my life chasing after money and stupid things like that, so i decided to work hard on becoming free	1.0 and what does that mean practically? what will you do differently?
0.0 i will work on the things i enjoy, which is knowledge and learning more and go for nature walks more often	1.0 i love walking in nature. hiking is a great way to exercise and to explore the outdoors
0.0 I've known my best friend since I was 4 years old.  He joined the Air Force after high school and moved out of state and I was really upset when he left.	1.0 Oh it's always sad when someone you care about leaves. Can you at least keep in contact with him?
0.0 Oh yeah, we still keep in contact over the Internet daily and visit each other every few years.  But I miss when we used to hang out every day.	1.0 I know. It is hard to say goodbye to people but he is doing a wonderful thing at least. 
0.0 the future is so uncertain and yet so certain i am so not ready for what's about to come it fills mee with anxiety and depression just thinking about it	1.0 Everything is going to be okay. Try to relax. 
0.0 i hope so	1.0 If there is something in particular, try to deal with it head on. 
0.0 I have been spending a year learning a new skill and after so much study and hard work it is finally paying off. I am feeling faithful again. 	1.0 that is great.. may i know what you have learnt
0.0 I have been learning to trade on the Forex markets.	1.0 it is challenging i guess.. best wishes that you developed skill over it
0.0 Thank you sir, have a great day!	1.0 great day to you too
0.0 i am so prepared the exam tomorrow!	1.0 How hard have you been studying? Exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time!
0.0 yup but i have been studying since for a year 	1.0 You sound very confident! I wish I had your confidence when I was in school.
0.0 tomorrow i have interview and i have done my study so i am feeling confident	1.0 I bet you will do great! What job is the interview for?
0.0 art design	1.0 That's a great field. My daughter just got a degree in art but she hasn't been able to find a job yet. Good luck tomorrow!
0.0 I did so well in that biology exam haha, i anticipated those questions to come up i was so ready	1.0 Good for you. Being prepared is always better than the alternative.
0.0 yup! defiently, i am so amazing 	1.0 Don't get too cocky but enjoy your victory you deserve it.
0.0 i am so mad at myself, i woke up late again today and missed a very important deadline, even though i set 4 alarms	1.0 Oh no! You must feel really bad. Are you able to fix the problem?
0.0 no, i can't i just need to fix myself as  i am the problem	1.0 Please try not to be so hard on yourself! We all make mistakes.
0.0 I really hate going to the doctor. I was hesitant about going this time.	1.0 Why do you need to go to the doctor?
0.0 I had a painful cyst and I knew I would have to get a needle.	1.0 Oh that's terrible. Did they take care of it?
0.0 I was planning on going to grad school and I told a lot of people. I ended up not going, and I felt embarrassed every time someone asked me about how school was going.	1.0 That sounds very uncomfortable. Were you honest with them about your change of plans?
0.0 Yes. Without really giving details, I always kind of shrugged off their questions and told them that it didn't work out.	1.0 Right. 
0.0 I found a picture of my daughter and me from when I took her to a waterfall a long time ago. It brought tears to my eyes.	1.0 Oh I bet that was amazing! I have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when I was young and it's a nice thing to think back on. Does your daughter remember it?
0.0 Yes she does. Of course she doesn't see the sentimentality of it yet as I do. She is only 23. 	1.0 One day she'll look back and it will mean so much to her! Memories with parents are the best ones.
0.0 I have the worst fear of carnival rides, i always think they	1.0 I totally understand, I hate carnival rides too, they always feel so rickety. Do you have a particular one you fear the most?
0.0 (pressed enter too early). I love thrill rides, but i don't trust any carnival ride that gets rebuilt every time the fair opens up, too many horror stories. I mostly hate the ones that spin you a million different directions.	1.0 Agreed, a good theme park is nice because you know they have high safety standards, but those carnival ones scare the crap out of me.
0.0 My wife's cousin was sent to the hospital and was placed in a medically induced coma with something having to do with his lungs	1.0 Oh my goodness! That sounds awful! Was this recently?
0.0 Yes. They aren't sure what's wrong but his oxygen level is down to 40%	1.0 I'm so sorry to hear that. Hopefully he has a good team of doctors that figure out what is going on. Are y'all able to visit him?
0.0 I was on the highway during a strong thunderstorm, no visibility. I had a bad feeling someone bad was going to happen and no more than 10 minutes later two cars in front of me crash and one gets flipped over.	1.0 That's so scary!  You must have strong intuition
0.0 Yeah I honestly don't but the whole mood on that highway just felt right for that to happen. A lot of people weaving and having their hazards on for no reason.	1.0 I'm so glad you came out of it okay.  I hate driving in bad weather and reckless driving just makes it worse.
0.0 Walking to a restaurant the other day and I forgot to hold the door open for an old lady, felt so bad about it because she was right next to the door too.	1.0 It was nice of you to at least think of it. I'm sure she wasn't that upset.
0.0 I hope so, i usually hold it open for everybody but i was distracted and didn't see her.	1.0 It's totally understandable. Life can get really busy sometimes!
0.0 I bought a new phone recently and not long after i dropped it and shattered the screen, first time this happens and it was just terrible.	1.0 Oh, that's not good. Did you get a warranty for the phone?
0.0 No I usually don't since i've never dropped mines but I do get warranty now. It wasn't a cheap repair either.	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out for you.
0.0 I was disgusted when my dog tried to attack another dog	1.0 Did the other dog provoke him? I wouldn't stress it too much, its just natural behavior for them, take him to training school.
0.0 Not really, but he knows better. I think I will get a trainer.	1.0 Oh then yeah, invest in a trainer. I love dogs a lot but an aggressive dog is very dangerous.
0.0 Saw an old cassette of my cousins fifteens and saw my mother before she passed away, felt nice seeing her on video again.	1.0 Oh I'm so sorry but I bet that was very special of you to find.
0.0 Yeah sadly we don't have many videos of her but the few we have we keep them safe and stored.	1.0 I would definitely make digital copies and upload to a cloud or a disk in case something happens.
0.0 I got the scores for my final exam. got a B and passed the class, it was a good day to celebrate.	1.0 That's awesome!  Congratulations!
0.0 Yeah, i pampered myself and went with some friends to a Japanese sushi place.	1.0 Nice choice!  Getting a B is definitely something to celebrate
0.0 Ordered a new pair of headphones online. They are a really high end pair so I'm very excited to finally get them.	1.0 That's exciting!  There's nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones
0.0 Yeah, it really is a day and night difference. Let's you appreciate the intricacies of a song much better.	1.0 I agree 100%.  Sounds like it's time to start downloading some new tunes to test out!
0.0 My wife is having a hard time after finding out we can no longer have children. I am doing my best to support her and care for her but it is very hard when nothing seems to work.	1.0 Oh thats heartbreaking, do you guys already have children?
0.0 I do but she doesn't. Which makes it harder I think. All I can do is be there for her and hope time helps her heal.	1.0 I really hope she gets better too, it must be terrible to know you cant have any kids. You're a good man for helping her cope.
0.0 Back in middle school i had a crush on a girl and one day in class she was talking to another guy. I was jealous for a while but it didn't matter anyways. I ended up getting her.	1.0 Young love, it's such a bittersweet quest.
0.0 It is, those were the funnest days. No responsibilities.	1.0 I know right? I wish I was young again sometimes.
0.0 I had a lot of feelings when I found pictures of my dog who has passed.	1.0 It's always difficult losing a pet.  I'm sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they're gone
0.0 It was very bittersweet. She could not work her legs anymore due to age.	1.0 You just have to remember what a good life she had with you!
0.0 I moved to my current town one year ago and I really like it here. I'm happy and couldn't think of a better place to live.	1.0 Nice! Why do you like it more than other places you've lived?
0.0 It's my first time living in a small town. I love the fresh air. I have also met some great people.	1.0 That's good! I've always heard that people are closer friends to each other in a small town.
0.0 I very much could count on my mom to always be there for me.	1.0 That's a blessing.  I know a lot of people didn't have a mom like that.
0.0 Me too. I am so thankful for her.	1.0 Is there anything she does specifically for her?
0.0 I was upset when I failed my math test	1.0 I'm sorry. I know how that feels. Did you study really hard?
0.0 I did, but the material was a hard subject.	1.0 Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask your teacher for some extra help or find a study buddy. i hope you do better next time.
0.0 I'm glad I can trust my husband to always be there for me.	1.0 That's sweet! I have a great husband too! How long have you been married?
0.0 Just under two years. Still feel like a newlywed@	1.0 That's great! We've been married for almost 10 years and I still feel like a newlywed. It's great when you marry your best friend.
0.0 Hi friend! Wow, I was so scared of this taxi driver when I was vacationing in Mexico. He looked rather suspicious.	1.0 Oh gosh! That sounds frightening! Did you get out the taxi as soon as you could?
0.0 No, I just trusted him. But I wrote all his details in my phone just in case. 	1.0 Oh, well that was a smart thing to do. I would've bailed. lol
0.0 I was storing all of my old photos on my new external hard drive yesterday. It made me wish I could go back and time and see some relatives again.	1.0 I usually love the trips down memory lane, but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around. I'm sorry.
0.0 It's bittersweet! Nice to see their faces again, but sad to miss them.	1.0 I'm right there with you. It makes you shed a tear sometimes too.
0.0 I lied to my friend about something and told her something was okay when it really wasn't	1.0 Oh. I know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations. Hopefully you did this to protect someone's feelings
0.0 I just felt really bad and guilty that I did it.	1.0 Yeah, I think that means you have a conscience, which is a good thing. If you didn't feel bad, I'd worry about you!
0.0 Sometimes a fly gets in my apartment and I hold my cat over my head and we chase it. She hasn't scratched or bitten me once while we do this!	1.0 That would make a funny video! We have a super friendly, playful cat too.
0.0 I love cats. They're so funny and such good company!	1.0 Yes, they are. He is my daughter's best friend. She can do whatever she wants and he is unphased.
0.0 I babysat my nephew overnight last weekend. He was scared so I let him sleep in bed with me, even though he kicks a lot.	1.0 That was thoughtful, sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone. hope you didn't get kicked too much!
0.0 Haha I didn't sleep a wink. He's only 8. He pretends to be all cool, but he's still very much a little kid.	1.0 Kids are interesting creatures that's for sure. I'm sure you got some cool uncle points.
0.0 I'm an auntie :p	1.0 My mistake :)
0.0 my pet dog is always there for me. No matter what, I can count on her.	1.0 I feel the same way about my dog.  They're the greatest!
0.0 yes they are they are always happy to see you and they will always there for you	1.0 I don't know what I would do without my dog.  I'm glad you have one that's always there for you!
0.0 I had a great breakfast this morning. It was delicious and I felt very happy and relaxed.	1.0 Nice! What did you have? I am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight.
0.0 Eggs, bacon, strawberries, tomatoes, and coffee. So yummy!	1.0 Mmmm. that sounds really good! I'm thinking biscuit and sausage gravy, hash brown and eggs...
0.0 I called someone by the wrong name earlier today. I didn't really know them and hadn't seen them in ages.	1.0 I hate when that happens. I bet you meant well but you're left looking like a crazy person! I hope they understood.
0.0 They were ok with it, but I hope I didn't hurt their feelings.	1.0 I think they will get over it. Most people understood that not everyone is going to remember every little thing.
0.0 The other day we were in the front yard, and you won't believe what happened!	1.0 What happened? The yard always has mysteries!
0.0 My 4 year-old just dropped his pants and started peeing in the grass!	1.0 Shocking! Has your kid done that before?
0.0 I got into an argument with my husband and I realized later that he was right but I never apologized. :(	1.0 Maybe you should find him and apologize right now.
0.0 Yes maybe I should but my ego gets in the way.	1.0 You could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead. 
0.0 That is a cool idea! Thanks for the great advice! I will do that right now. :)	1.0 Your welcome! Glad I could help!
0.0 I'm unemployed and struggling right now. I feel really bad when people talk to me about their new stuff, even though they're not trying to be mean	1.0 I can understand the feeling, I went through a couple of spells like that in the past. I'm sure they mean well but you're at a point where you're hurting to get back out there.
0.0 yeah! I just want to be able to support myself and not go to the food bank or rely on friends and family	1.0 You'll return to self-sufficiency soon, you just can't let yourself fall into a pit of self doubt. Stay confident.
0.0 I am so sad. My 3 dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries. Crying....	1.0 Aww, that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.
0.0 It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals.	1.0 That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves
0.0 One of my love birds had a baby but she is a terrible mother. So I am now taking care of the baby and feeding her everyday. She is so cute!	1.0 Ah what a responsibly to take on! You are a great example, is it quite tough?
0.0 No. The baby bird just sleeps and eats do it is really easy. 	1.0 Alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then?
0.0 Yes! I think so, haha!	1.0 Keep up the good work!
0.0 I feel very happy that I moved out in the country. I thought I was a city person but I guess not.	1.0 I bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night.
0.0 Oh yes. It was hard to get used to at first but now I barely notice it.	1.0 All that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it.
0.0 Yes I think so. I especially enjoy this night owl that hoo's everynight.	1.0 Living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too.
0.0 Sure does. Your welcome to visit any time my friend.	1.0 Thanks that is quite the offer. How kind.
0.0 I really wanted to go on this fruitarian trip to Bali butI could not get off work. My friends went without me	1.0 Did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off?
0.0 No. My boss is not a very nice person. I think I should find a new job.	1.0 Yeah you might want to look into it then
0.0 My dog is feeling sick and I don't know what is wrong.	1.0 Oh no! Have you tried taking your dog to the vet?
0.0 I hate the vets. They charge so much money. Maybe I can google seomthing.	1.0 Yes, google has a lot of great information for pet care.
0.0 I am learning how to do day trading and did my first trade and I won	1.0 Well that sounds like a high stress occupation!
0.0 You think? It sure is exciting, at least when I win.	1.0 I'm glad you like it. I think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes.
0.0 Your right. Let's see how I do next week.	1.0 I wish you the very best with it all!
0.0 Thanks my friend!	1.0 You're welcome. Be careful not to chase stocks too hard, they don't always turn the way you might hope!
0.0 My dogs keep attacking my poor ducks. I don't know what to do	1.0 I don't know what you can do. A duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog.
0.0 I scream at the dogs and it seems to be working but I never know what can happen in the future.	1.0 Dogs gonna do dog stuff. That's just how they do.
0.0 I packing to go on an international trip. I hope I don't forget anything.	1.0 That would be bad you should double check before you leave
0.0 I feel I can't fit anything else in my suitcase so I think I have it all. But I will double check like you said. :)	1.0 Yeah it is better to be safe than sorry
0.0 I was ashamed when my dog started barking loudly when I was away.	1.0 Why were you ashamed? Did she disturb the neighbors or something?
0.0 Yes, my neighbors were very angry.	1.0 I'm sorry that happened. You might need to get her obedience training, 
0.0 I am exciting that my father said he would come and visit me soon. He travels so much and it is hard to get his time	1.0 Thats awesome! do yall have any plans? 
0.0 We are just going to hang out on the farm and hang out with the cows, ha ha	1.0 lol maybe yall could find something to bond over
0.0 Oh how I miss my days when I was in my twenties. Those were such fun times. To be young and free!	1.0 Yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone
0.0 It is so true. We take it for granted. I wish I knew then what I know now.	1.0 Yeah we all do but we can only go forward
0.0 My cockatiel is feeling sick. I think she might die soon. I wish there was something I could do.	1.0 Have you taken her to the vet?
0.0 No. There are no vets where I live. I gave her some medicine though but nothing seems to be working.	1.0 You might want to look up what is going on online
0.0 yesterday i notice people were laughing behind me, when I finally got to my desk, a coworker pointed out that a postage stamp was stuck to the back of my head	1.0 That sucks. Next time they should tell you instead of laughing!
0.0 well looking back its funny, but man, yesterday i wished i could hide, plus I think my boss seen it too	1.0 I'm sure it's not so bad. At least you can laugh about it now!
0.0 i am up for a promotion at my job. I positive I will get it.	1.0 That is great! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment
0.0  I already have plans to go out to a nice restaurant and celebrate with my family	1.0 that is good! I hope you enjoy yourself
0.0 i have a big presentation at my job at the end of this week. I am ready for it	1.0 Awesome! What's it about?
0.0 its about how some customers are not choosing our slow moving products. i have been working on it for weeks. i got it nailed down	1.0 Congrats! I hope it goes well. Are you presenting to a board of directors?
0.0 a neighbor  just bought a brand new Lexus, why can't I get one	1.0 Maybe you can save more and be able to get one.
0.0 its not just that, this neighbor is always buying expensive things and likes to show them off	1.0 Man that gets to me when someone does that , like they are better than everyone else.
0.0 i really miss the holidays when our family got together	1.0 The holidays are a great time for that sort of thing. What did your family do together?
0.0 just the normal stuff, but the kids are all grown up.Holidays are never the same without having kids around to enjoy it	1.0 I understand what you mean.  I hope you and your family are all able to get together and enjoy each other's company soon.
0.0 There is a job promotion coming up. I really do wish i can get it	1.0 I hope you can have you applied or did you interview already?
0.0 i have interview for it and thinking i might get it but you never know	1.0 well have you practiced interviewing? With that you can feel so much better!
0.0 i thought I was going to get a promotion. I found out I did not get it	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully something better is coming along for you soon.
0.0 thank you, i was really depending on this promotion	1.0 Keep working hard and I think your efforts will eventually be noticed.
0.0 my pet dog pooped all over my rug last week. She never did that before	1.0 Ah that always sucks, did she need to go out or is she sick or something?
0.0 i don't know, she never did that before, i don't know if the crap or her behavior got to me more	1.0 Well it isn't as if she did it on purpose dogs always have a reason.
0.0 ugh, I have a cavity and I do not want to go to the dentist	1.0 Oh no, is it painful and disrupting you in anyway? 
0.0 its painful but the thought of it being pulled kind of freaks me out plus the cost of it.	1.0 Yeah, I know what you mean it does sound very scary, but they do numb your face and usually they do not pull it out, they fill in the cavity! 
0.0 We didn't really have anything planned this last weekend, so were thinking we'd be productive.	1.0 What did you do?
0.0 Well, plans got changed.  It rained like crazy, so we couldn't work outside.	1.0 It has been raining a lot here too. Definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house.
0.0 It was okay, though. We got to spend some time hanging out and had a low-key weekend.	1.0 That's good, sometimes it's good to just be lazy inside the house.
0.0 I still haven't been able to finish my dad's Father's Day gift.	1.0 so are you making him a gift?
0.0 Yeah, we're rebuilding a porch swing for him.  But I've had to hunt down some tooling.	1.0 don't worry about it you will get it done and he will be proud of it
0.0 i have to fly out of town next week. I do not know if I can, I have cold sweats thinking about it	1.0 Do you have a general fear of flying, or is there something about this trip?
0.0 it s the fear of flying, just the thought of it frightens me	1.0 Have you always had a fear of flying?  I haven't ever really feared it, but I don't like it.
0.0 Man, I really thought today could be a crazy day.	1.0 Was it another boring day today? 
0.0 Well, it sort of turned out that way.  There was a big event at work today, and I wasn't sure how it would go.	1.0 Ohh okay I see, yeah I always get excited when new things happen at work too. 
0.0 over the weekend i  fell off my diet by eating a big bag of peanut M&Ms	1.0 I know the feeling. Hang in there! tomorrow is always a new day 
0.0 you know the worst part of it, is that i hid it from my partner who is proud of me dieting, i feel bad for it	1.0 Did you hide the wrappers?
0.0 I always buy the same brand of yogurt and don't even bother trying other kinds. It's just so delicious and such a good price that I'm a loyal customer for life	1.0 There's very few brands I feel that strongly about. What kind of yogurt is it, I might want to try it?
0.0 Astro balkan plain! It's not as pastey as greek yogurt, or runny like other kinds	1.0 I don't think I have ever seen that kind in the store, I'll have to look for it next time I go. I don't care much for the runny yogurt, but I like greek yogurt so long as it's whole fat and sweet.
0.0 I lost my job because I got diagnosed with a chronic disease. It's a real double whammy - loss of income and an incurable disease. I'm still angry and upset, three months later.	1.0 That is horrible. Americas government wont be of help....hopefully you have family?
0.0 No I'm all by myself	1.0 No cat or dog?
0.0 Have you ever had a strong attachment and love for an animal?   I have had several.	1.0 Yes I love animals and have 3 dogs right now.
0.0 Well then you will understand the love I had for my pitbull named Lily.   We had a special bond and when she died it broke my heart.  Never leave a candle burning and leave the house.   OUr house burned and she died of smoke inhalation.  I will never forget her!	1.0 I'm sorry that happened to you and I will take your advice.
0.0 Once during a snowstorm I had to go to the airport. My taxi driver decided that driving on the highway in the middle of nowhere late at night was the perfect time to tell me all about how he would kill a man	1.0 That sounds super scary, could he tell that your were scared or nervous? How did you escape that situation?
0.0 I shrank into myself and prayed for the car to go faster and not crash	1.0 Oh wow, it's fortunate that you managed to get out of that situation alive. I'm glad you made it out of that awful situation. 
0.0 One time there was a homeless guy running towards my car	1.0 That sounds a little scary. Why was he running towards your car?
0.0 He wanted money!	1.0 Did you give him any?
0.0 I'm really stressed today so I bought a box of Pirate peanut butter cookies and ate an entire sleeve of them. I feel pretty bad because I wrecked my dieting for at least two days	1.0 Aww, I am sorry, but I must say Pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good, did they help you feel any better?
0.0 In the short term, yes! They're oatmeal and peanut butter	1.0 Ugh, that sounds wonderful, I would do the same if I were stressed I think
0.0 One time I saw a person juggle chainsaws	1.0 That's amazing. Were you impressed?
0.0 Yes, he did it perfectly and did not hurt himself	1.0 That must take a lot of practice. I can't even juggle safe objects so I'd likely lose an arm if I tried to juggle chainsaws lol
0.0 I'm very ready for school to start!	1.0 Me, too!  I work at the registration department at a college and we're very busy until school starts.
0.0 There's just something so nostalgic about going to school. Reminds me of my childhood.	1.0 I think it's the feeling of the beginning of something new.
0.0 One time my mom made me lunch when I was too busy working!	1.0 Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you! 
0.0 I hope so! She always helps me and one day I will return the favor!	1.0 Wow that is fantastic, she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person. :) 
0.0 My friend got a new job and I wish I had it too.	1.0 Good for you friend! I'm sure you'll find something soon. What field of work do you want to be in?
0.0 I work in video production. Super fun job, but I'm tired of the freelance life.	1.0 That does sound like a really fun job. I also work freelance and would also like something more stable. 
0.0 One time my family went out to vacation and I was home alone with no friends	1.0 Oh no, they went on vacation without you?? 
0.0 Yes, I had to work and could not get time off!	1.0 Oh no that sucks, I am sorry that you had to stay home alone. What did you do to entertain yourself? 
0.0 My pet cat died recently	1.0 Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. How are you holding up? 
0.0 I am doing okay, my cat was old and is probably in a better place now :'(	1.0 Yes, I am sure that your cat is in a better place. If you ever want to talk to someone about it I am always here to listen. :) 
0.0 I am ready for my law exam	1.0 The big one? The bar? That's a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test! I imagine you're very excited, but anxious too.
0.0 Luckily not the bar yet! Just the end of summer class.	1.0 Ahh. Still, another stone set on the road to payoff. I wish you the best!
0.0 I knew I was ready for my college exam.	1.0 You study hard?
0.0 I did. Failed my last so I knew I had to make it right.	1.0 Oh no, I bet you aced this one then.
0.0 My brother keeps not washing the dishes!	1.0 Oh no, have you talked to him about it? 
0.0 Yes! He is such a manchild! He does not care about cleanliness!	1.0 Aww man, that sucks, I am guessing that you end up having to do all the dirty work because he has been slacking off. 
0.0 I was so mad when my dog got my dinner off the table.	1.0 Oh I would be pissed. Hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate.
0.0 I did, but he knows better.	1.0 Guessing he didn't get anymore food for dinner lol.
0.0 I visited my college campus today and memories came flooding back. I miss it.	1.0 I'd imagine so. What a great time of our lives college can be. The world just seems right, being surrounded by your peers, all sharing similar goals. 
0.0 It was so great. We all just wanted to learn.	1.0 Mmhm. I wish I studied more, paid more attention, and joined more clubs. But I guess that's the thing, you're already as busy as it gets, and unfortunately you can't experience it all.
0.0 I think I will pass my college test tomorrow.	1.0  That is great, confidence is always a key in success! I believe that you will pass as well! 
0.0 Thank you. I'm ready for it to be over with.	1.0 Yeah I bet! You will do great, I have high hopes in you! :) 
0.0 I was a bit upset when my parents could not visit me this weekend.	1.0 Aw, that stinks. Why couldn't they come?
0.0 My dad had to work last minute. I got everything ready for them. Oh well.	1.0 That sounds really disappointing. Hopefully, you'll be able to see them soon! I'm sure they were excited too.
0.0 I was grossed out when I saw someone vomiting at a bar.	1.0 Oh man, I bet you did. I would have had a gag reflex if I saw some one puking at the bar. 
0.0 They couldn't even make it to the bathroom. Ugh.	1.0 Wow they must have had 1 too many drinks if they could not even get to the bathroom. I am sorry you had to see such a disgusting sight 
0.0 I'm very scared of the afterlife	1.0 Me too, it's so hard not knowing what to expect.
0.0 And we do not even know if we have an afterlife.	1.0 Right, no one truly knows until they get there, so scary.
0.0 I was very happy just reading a book by the pool today	1.0 What was the book about?
0.0 It was about the golden state killer. Very errie.	1.0 I'm glad you were happy reading the book.
0.0 I was very nervous for my first day of freshman year in college.	1.0 Oh, I understand. I also remember mine. Do you remember something else about that day?
0.0 I could not find my classes. It was almost comical.	1.0 I imagine it was a big college. what did happen at the end?
0.0 One time I won a stuffed animal from the claw machine!	1.0 Me too! I love that game!
0.0 Yup, I did it in my first try too!	1.0 I saw a machine one time that you could win live lobsters. They would cook it for you if you won.
0.0 I was so happy when my mom came to visit me	1.0 Nice! How long has it been since you last saw her?
0.0 6 months. Way too long!	1.0 Man, I hope you two do something fun!
0.0 I am scared of spiders!	1.0 All spiders or just the poisonous ones?
0.0 Any of them. I hate all their creepy legs.	1.0 Thats fair I guess, weird fish freak me out more then spiders through
0.0 My sister came over to my house the other day.  SHe was quick to show off her new iphone 8.	1.0 Wow, is she an older or younger sibling? 
0.0 She is 10 years younger than I am, and quite spoiled.  She always has the  nicest things.	1.0 Aww man that sucks, One day your hard work will pay off, so don't let it get to you too much. I am sure she is not intentially doing that
0.0 One time I saw a giant cockroach under my desk!	1.0 omg! I hate cockroaches, they are ugly insects 
0.0 Yes! they are so creepy with how fast and nasty they are1	1.0 were you able to kill it? what did you do?
0.0 I sprayed it with Raid	1.0 Well done. I hope you dont find anymore, they are scary. 
0.0 I thought it was so cool that my friend did a backflip.	1.0 Wow! that is really cool. Did he land the back flip?
0.0 He did! I didn't know he could do that.	1.0 What prompted his back flip?
0.0 I forgot to invite my friend to dinner with our other friends.	1.0 It happens sometimes.  It only becomes a problem if you forget often.
0.0 Luckily I have not done it too many times.	1.0 I hope they were pretty understanding.
0.0 One time I wanted to eat at Burger King, but then I remembered that I was loyal to Mcdonalds	1.0 I hate burger king! McD's all the way
0.0 Your dam right! Even if the food is small, it tastes so good!	1.0 Adding mac sauce to a cheeseburger is a game changer
0.0 I was upset when I did not do well on a test.	1.0 That is unfortunate, did you fail the test?
0.0 Not exactly, but close enough. I will study better next time.	1.0 You got this! I believe in you!
0.0 I was so mad when my friend forgot my birthday	1.0 Wow! Did you tell them anything?
0.0 I did a few days later. They seemed sorry.	1.0 You should stop being their friend!
0.0 One time my friend said that I could tell him anything and she would snitch	1.0 Oh, snitches are no fun.
0.0 Yes, snitches get stiches	1.0 I would just keep to myself.
0.0 I remember years ago when I was a teenager.  I didnt treat her as well as I should have.	1.0 Who?
0.0 Oh so sorry, I meant to say I didnt treat my mother as well as I should have.  I often treated her with disrespect and disobedience.	1.0 Well I think as long as you say sorry, she can forgive.
0.0 My dog kept barking and waking me up	1.0 I know how annoying that can be.  I love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times.
0.0 I still do not know why he was barking.	1.0 Maybe there was something outside or maybe he just wanted attention.   Dogs behavior can be hard to figure out sometimes.   Good Luck!
0.0 One time I pooped my pants when I was trying to fart	1.0 I have done that before. It is not fun.
0.0 Yup! I had to walk home in shame!	1.0 I hope you threw out those pants.

0.0 I could not believe that Donald Trump won the election.	1.0 Yeah, that was a surprising result.
0.0 I still do not know what to make of it	1.0 Does it make you feel like you're living in an alternate reality?
0.0 I did not like being alone at home at night.	1.0 it can be scary at times. How do you deal with it?
0.0 I try to go to bed earlier.	1.0 That is a good way. I have a dog that makes me feel safe. Do you have anything like that?
0.0 My family left for the weekend and I'm so bored.	1.0 You can watch some movies
0.0 What should I watch?	1.0 It depends on your preference. I watch korean dramas.
0.0 I have realized that I have it good in life	1.0 Life is always a lot better when the sun is shining.
0.0 Yes, I appreciate everything, even the sun 	1.0 When the sun is shining walking and seeing the beautiful sights makes me smile.

0.0 My dog was chewing on dead frog. So gross!! I hope it was not poisonous.	1.0 oh man dogs are crazy! My dog killed a cat recently, I hope it's not poison!! Is he okay?
0.0 He seems to be ok but if he start salivating then for sure there is poison. I will have to run to vet!!	1.0 oh no, you are a good dog owner though
0.0 When I bought my house I made sure I had everything all ready including my down payment	1.0 Sounds like you are doing all the right things. Did anything go wrong?
0.0 no it took 2 weeks to close and no issues came up	1.0 Oh that is great! Congratulations on your knew home! That must be so exciting!
0.0 I am so happy today because my peacocks just had 3 babies! They are so cute!	1.0 that's the coolest thing ever I didn't know you could have them as pets
0.0 Oh yes! I have 3 adult females and one male. I have had them for 5 years. They have names and I can call them and they come running to me. They are cool pets.	1.0 My kids would love something like that
0.0 Lately I hav been hearing some big monkeys howling up in the mountain. I hope they don't come down near my house.	1.0 Monkeys!!!??? I have never heard monkeys howl.  Tell me more.
0.0 It is hard to give you an example through text but it does sound like a monster in the mountains. Kind of scary! haha	1.0 Where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains?  I live in Florida, the flatlands. lol
0.0 I live in Florida too but have a second home in Mexico. They are in the jungles and are wild there.	1.0 Sounds exciting.  But I would have been scared of howling monkeys too.  I am not sure why, but the term "howling monkeys" makes me giggle.
0.0 Haha, It is a funny situation. Chat with you later my friend!	1.0 Bye! Watch out for those monkeys!
0.0 just heard I got the promotion I was hoping for. I think I am going to burst.	1.0 oh that is so exciting!!! good for you man!
0.0 thanks, i thing I am going to celebrate when I get home tonight	1.0 yeah pop that champagne!
0.0 I am on vacation in Bali and I want to move here so badly. It is the most beautiful place in the world!	1.0 That sounds awesome! What's your favorite part of your vacation so far?
0.0 I love hiking through the rice fields and the fruit here is out of this world!!	1.0 What kinds of fruit do they have there?
0.0 WHen I was about 13 years old I worked at a horse farm in exchange for lessons.  I would go there every weekend and all through the summer.  	1.0 That's great that they let you work in exchange for lessons. I bet you have the best memories.
0.0 Yes I have very fond memories from those days.  I can still remember the smell of the farm and the smell of horses like it was yesterday.  I never wanted to wash the smell from my hands and I would daydream about owning my own horse someday.	1.0 That's awesome. Do you own a horse now?
0.0 Studied for my math finals for days, felt very confident on the day of the test.	1.0 That's awesome! Yeah I definitely find the more I study, the better I do. Funny how that works! 
0.0 Yeah, but theres a balance. study too much and you just burn yourself out	1.0 True. There has to be a work/school/life balance. 
0.0 My dad got sick for a week and I stayed at home for a week taking care of him	1.0 Well I hope he gets to felling better.
0.0 He's better already but he got a real bad fever during that week	1.0 You should keep an eye on him older people are more prone to getting sick.
0.0 I drank all the milk in the fridge and left nothing for anyone else. Next week I will buy extra milk for the house to make up for it.	1.0 That's very considerate of you. I know some people that drink it all and don't replace it.
0.0 Yeah, I have done that before and I got yelled at by everyone. I learned my lesson. Haha	1.0 Lol it happens, what's important is that you learned and care enough about your people to internalize the knowledge.
0.0 Looking through old stuff in the attic and stumbled across my old gamecube, sadly it didn't work anymore.	1.0 Awww, I never had one, but wanted one.
0.0 Yeah i had good memories playing with my friends	1.0 What were your favorite games?
0.0 My old roommate didn't clean out his room or kitchen when he left. My school charged the rest of us $100 because of him.	1.0 Wow, thats terrible. Did you get him to pay you all back?
0.0 No, he cut off all communication. Nobody liked him anyways, he was dirty and rude.	1.0 Well good riddance. If you never want to see scum again, just loan them $20.
0.0 I was disappointed with the score of my final exam. I studied real hard but got a 64% on it.	1.0 I'm sorry. It sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad. Could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy?
0.0 Yea i had a study group I just panicked when i entered the testing room i think. It's not so bad though, i still passed the class.	1.0 Well that's good news. I hope you do better on your next test.
0.0 I live very far away from my family and I miss them dearly. I feel so alone sometimes.	1.0 Aw, I know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on.
0.0 Yes it is quite hard. But it has been my choice to move away. I guess one day I will return but not sure when.	1.0 That's good that you are keeping your options open and even better that you challenged yourself to leave comfort and travel.
0.0 One time in high school I sat in chocolate sauce! I didn't have a sweater to tie around my waste, so I had to borrow one from a friend.	1.0 Oh no! that's horrifying in high school! I hope you didn't get made fun of.
0.0 One of the bully kids noticed the sweater around my waste on the warm day and knew something was up. He really tried to embarrass me.	1.0 Kids can be so mean. Thank God that's all behind us now!
0.0 Recently moved to a new dorm and when i came in the kitchen was a total disaster. Months old piles of dishes in the sink with mold and dried up old food on the stove.	1.0 Holy crap! Is there not a landlord or something you can complain to?
0.0 I can but they take forever to come and clean it up. I just talked to the guy who did it and he said he won't do it again. Spent  an hour cleaning it all up with a lot of clorox, alcohol, and soap.	1.0 I'm glad I never had to live with other people. I would not be as patient as you.
0.0 When i was waiting for my final grade report to come in. I was scared i was going to fail my organic chem class.	1.0 Did you pass?
0.0 Yeah, got a 73% on the class. Not ideal but better than failing.	1.0 Absolutely. Great job!
0.0 I have complete faith in my diet. It makes me feel great!	1.0 I completely agree, having complete control over your diet is amazing and has a ton of benefits
0.0 It's easier to maintain than people realize!	1.0 Yeah, and it can be cost effective if you plan wisely!
0.0 I was driving down the highway during a heavy thunderstorm and two cars crashed in front of me and one flipped over.	1.0 Oh my goodness! That is scary! Are you alright? Did anyone get hurt?
0.0 Yeah im alright, i was far enough to steer clear of the chaos. The guy that flipped had to get carried by ambulance, but he didn't look very injured. and the other guy was ok.	1.0 Whew! You are lucky! Glad to hear everyone was ok. 
0.0 My dog died in my neighbors electrical fence last night. I am devastated!! I don't know what to do.	1.0 Oh no, poor dog :( I'd be devastated too, i love dogs so much.
0.0 My heart is broken and I can't stop crying. I feel so helpless that I could not save her. 	1.0 Don't beat yourself up over it, it was a very tragic accident but who could've known. He's in a better place now.
0.0 Recently, my wife and I needed a babysitter for the evening, and my mother-in-law offered to watch our kids.	1.0 That was nice of her. Did everything work out?
0.0 No, she forgot.  Which, unfortunately, is typical!	1.0 Oh no! Did you guys stillhave a nice evening?
0.0 Yeah, it worked out okay to take the kids with. It just wasn't quite as relaxing.	1.0 Yeah I thought of that. well, the kids probably loved it!
0.0 I really enjoy collecting shoes, and i'm hoping to get a pair of Yeezy's that are restocking this october.	1.0 Very nice.  How many shoes do you have?
0.0 i have around 7 right now	1.0 Are they all Yeezys?
0.0 I feel so happy to live out in the country. Nature is the most beautiful thing to experience everyday!	1.0 That sounds so nice!  Are you very far from grocery stores and stuff?
0.0 Only about a 30 minute drive. Not to close and not to far. But we grow some of our food here and we have cows and chickens too.	1.0 Yeah, that's not too bad at all!  Sounds idyllic!
0.0 Back in highschool when i got my first car, i was so happy and drove it around for a while and it felt so nice being free to roam.	1.0 Oh yes.  The first car is amazing
0.0 Yeah its a great feeling having someone thats yours.	1.0 Yes I remember the freedom that comes with the first car.
0.0 I feel anxious when I have to wait for people that are late. Why can't everyone just be on time?	1.0 I feel exactly the same way.  People should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others.
0.0 Yes totally agree! Maybe I should just leave and make them wait. Haha	1.0 Yes, that would certainly give them a taste of their own medicine!
0.0 It's really hard to stay disciplined and watch what you eat.	1.0 I agree, it's something I struggle with as well. Have you tried an diets you liked?
0.0 I haven't done anything specific with diets, no.  Have you found one that you like?	1.0 I've tried a few, and I would have to say the one that I liked the most was Weight Watchers. It's pretty easy to stay on, and the food is usually good. The only big problem is that it gets expensive.
0.0 "It was my birthday and my whole family threw a party for me after work. It was so unexpected!	1.0 That's so cool! Did they get you anything nice?
0.0 They got me a bunch of gift cards to my favorite stores. They are all so wonderful. I love them so much!	1.0 Time to go shoppin lol!
0.0 At the beginning of the year I missed a lot of work.  I was sick but I didnt feel like a team player at the time.	1.0 Aw Im sorry. Are you doing better now?
0.0 yeah I'm doing much better thanks.  I'll for sure be getting a flu shot next year!	1.0 That's a good idea. I haven't done that in years. I always feel like I barely dodge a bullet by not getting it.
0.0 I have been lucky in the past but I dont remember the last time I have felt that sick. I definitely dont want to go through that again.	1.0 Glad you are doing better!
0.0 i have to go out of town, i am not looking forward to flying	1.0 I feel you, but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation.
0.0 i keep telling myself flying is safe but I am petrified of getting on that plane	1.0 I see, I think you may consider a tylenol or some type of sleep pill for the flight, to ensure that you don't feel uncomfortable or paranoid during travel.
0.0 My father has been such a great father. He is such a hard worker and loves his family so much. He is such a great man.	1.0 That's awesome. I was always a daddy's boy growing up.
0.0 Awww, yeah Daddy's can be the best! I wish all children could have good daddy's.	1.0 Amen. Mine was a good man. He taught me a lot of good life lessons.
0.0 I have a stuffed animal that my old dog used to lay by/on as a pillow. My dog is dead but I still keep that stuffed animal to remind me of him	1.0 I am sorry your dog passed away, I totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him. Was he old when he passed?
0.0 He was about 12.  He was my first dog though! He was a sweetheart.  It is nice keeping something to remind me of him.	1.0 I'm glad you have something that helps keep his memory alive. :)
0.0 I was hoping to get an interview for a higher position and was told I would get that at least.  However, the recruiter didnt look at internal candidates and by the time it was reported they had hired someone from the outside.	1.0 Aw what a sham! Did they give any reason why they hired from the outside?
0.0 My boss said the recruiter is an idiot and just never looked at internal candidates. It was a bummer but I figure I'll look for something else in the company soon	1.0 Well that's a good attitude to have. I don't blame you for being mad. I would be.
0.0 I am getting a new car this week! I can't wait to smell the new leather seats!	1.0 Oh man, that is exciting! Do you know what kind?
0.0 It's a beautiful 2018 yellow jeep! The car of my dreams! So stoked!	1.0 That's awesome!! I love jeeps!  congratulations, that's great news!
0.0 A bird fell out of a tree next to my house. I am now the mother and taking care of her. We are developing such a beautiful relationship.	1.0 That's so sweet.  What kind of bird is it?
0.0 I think it is a love bird. She thinks I am the mother and it is so cool when she walks all over me and comes when I call her. I have never had a pet bird before.	1.0 Aww, I'd love to see a video of that.
0.0 I met a cow the other day and I went to go pet her. Something inside me told me to get away. Later that day the owner told me to stay away from her because she is known to attack people.	1.0 You're lucky the cow didnt hurt you.
0.0 Yes I think so. That probably could have killed me. But I guess it was not my time. I angels saved me.	1.0 Good thing you listened to your gut feeling
0.0 I need to go to the grocery store but it is storming outside. Not sure if I should go or not.	1.0 Hopefully it will stop soon. That's the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand.
0.0 Actually I have no food and I am starving. Maybe I should order a pizza. But then the delivery guy will have the same problem.	1.0 Well that is what they get paid for. Just be sure to tip him well.
0.0 i came home yesterday, i found my sofa torn up, let's say this I am not very  happy with my pet dog	1.0 Uh oh. I bet he knew he was in trouble. Did you get him a crate?
0.0 i was on the verge of something more serious and probably would have regret it	1.0 Yeah, I'm glad you didn't do anything you would regret. I hope he is better for you in the future.
0.0 I am so hurt that my baby goat died. My dogs were playing to rough and killer her. Man I should have stopped it sooner. It is all my fault. :(	1.0 Oh no! I'm so sorry about that. Don't blame yourself, animals like to play with each other!
0.0 Yes but I think I could have avoided it. I am training my dogs now to stay away from the goats. I hope it doesn't happen again.	1.0 That sounds like a good plan. You definitely don't want that to happen again. Sometimes bad things happen in order for us to learn and avoid it again.
0.0 I went fishing with my 4 year-old about a month ago.	1.0 That sounds great, I can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age. Did your 4 year-old have a good time?
0.0 He did!  He caught 4 fish all by himself.	1.0 Wow, that's impressive! I'm glad he had a good time.
0.0 My dog was stung by a bug.  His lip got huge and looked really funny but I felt terrible for him!	1.0 Poor doggy! Did you have to take him to the vet?
0.0 I did end up taking him in. Luckily it wasnt too serious and he was fine a couple days later.  He looked so sad with his big lip!	1.0 I bet he did, I'm glad he's okay though.
0.0 my best friend friend helped me through some rough spots with my marriage and job. I am gland he was there for me	1.0 Thats really nice you have a friend like that.That's hard to come by. I hope everything is better for you now.
0.0 thank you, i do not know how i will repay him back, I will always be in his debt	1.0 I'm sure he doesn't expect it but thats a really nice thing he did.
0.0 I feel so bad to see so many homeless people on the streets these days. I hope I am never homeless.	1.0 I hope you arent and I'm not too! It would be rough living on the streets.
0.0 Yeah especially when it is snowing outside. Can you just imagine having to sleep outside like that . Oh! So sad!	1.0 It would be terrible in the winter.  I cant imagine sleeping outside when its freezing
0.0 I went out to eat with my girlfriend last week.  It was an awesome atmosphere and the food was great!	1.0 That sounds fun! Where did you go?
0.0 We went to a greek place.  There were belly dancers and a ton of good meats and appetizers. I think we'll check it out again this weekend since it was so fun!	1.0 Mmmmm, I love greek food! That sounds appetizing! I think I will take my girl there too this week!
0.0 as I walk through my house, the rooms are empty, There is no one there for me	1.0 I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.
0.0 that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with	1.0 I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.
0.0 I have no children but I have a ton of animals. I love them all so much. They are my children.	1.0 What kinds of pets do you have?
0.0 I have chickens, ducks, parrots, cockatiels, budgies, peacocks, guinea pigs, dogs, goats and cows. haha 	1.0 oh wow! you did say a ton! I love animals too. wish I lived somewhere I could have more.
0.0 When my son was born, we knew that something was up before he came out.  It was pretty scary.	1.0 Did he have superpowers?
0.0 Hah - no.  But he did have the cord wrapped around his neck twice, and he'd tied an overhand knot in it, too.	1.0 That's pretty impressive.
0.0 I was in a rush this morning and I dressed my self in stained clothes. I feel so dirty today. :(	1.0 Oh wow, are you going to be in front of anyone important?
0.0 Not today. I just feel insecure about it, like everyone is looking at me. It is probably just all in my head.	1.0 Usually, you are the one who notices it the most. 
0.0 My cows are finally pregnant. I can't wait for my baby calves to be born!	1.0 wow, that must be an interesting thing to be involved with. lots of milk too, i presume.
0.0 Oh, yes! Fresh raw milk is so wonderful and one of the best foods we can eat.	1.0 very cool, wish i could get into something like that. sounds fun
0.0 i miss my old pet dog, i feel so empty without her around	1.0 Awww, I understand. Dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly. 
0.0 i know that what makes it harder not having her around, no companionship	1.0 Maybe also looking into getting a new dog, I know it's hard, but you can get through it! Your friends and family are always there as well.
0.0 I am so envious of those that can travel the world and get paid for it.	1.0 That sounds like such an enjoyable life. If only it was so easy!
0.0 Yeah, maybe in my next life I guess, haha.	1.0 Haha, that is true. But we have to make the most of this one. 
0.0 When I was in high school there was a senior I had a crush on and I was a sophomore.  I ended up asking her out but got rejected. Later on in college we actually became pretty good friends.	1.0 Oh man heart breaker. Thats good yall are friends though. You never know maybe one day yall will be married
0.0 Haha, I hope not...my current girlfriend would probably be a little upset! She's a nice person (the one from high school) but I dont think I could ever marry her	1.0 you dont still have any feelings at all for her?
0.0 I am learning how sew my own clothes. I am studying hard and I think I will be able to make my first outfit!	1.0 Ooh, I've always wanted to learn how to do that. You must be so excited!
0.0 Yes, I have so many ideas! How cool it would be to not have to buy any more expensive clothes and make my own! 	1.0 Omg, that would be awesome. I might just have to learn how to do that myself.
0.0 I just made a huge feast and now I am excited for all my guests to arrive to my baby shower!	1.0 Ooo! That's exciting! Congrats on your baby! I hope your guests enjoy their time. 
0.0 Thank you! I have so many fun games planned and lots of great food.	1.0 Yay! That sounds like so much fun. Baby showers are a great way to bring everyone together.
0.0 I trust the way my body feels to know if I'm generally healthy or not	1.0 Usually it will let you know if something is wrong. Part of how we are designed! 
0.0 Exactly! The human body is interesting!	1.0 It is, everything has to be balanced just right, or else we feel it.
0.0 I went to a restaurant and after I got the bill I realized that I did not have my wallet on me! The manager was yelling at me demanding me to pay before I left.	1.0 Oh no, how did you make things right with the manager. I am sure he is just wanting to get paid. 
0.0 Yes, he did want to get paid but I needed to go home and get my wallet. He got angry with me but what could I do? I had no money with me.	1.0 That is a tough spot to be in, maybe you could of washed dishes for him. Or give him your phone for collateral. 
0.0 I just left but I came straight back and paid. All was fine in the end. But I will never go to that restaurant again.	1.0 That is good, such an embarrassing situation to be in.
0.0 I really wanted an Oculus Rift.  I saved up enough and had to wait about a week before it was in stock at the store	1.0 Oh man I want that too! did you get it?
0.0 I did!  It is by far the coolest thing I have ever bought!	1.0 Do you use your computer?
0.0 yeah, I have it plugged into my computer.  I cant tell you, or even begin to explain, how real everything feels when you use it.	1.0 How much do they go for?
0.0 It was $400, having a computer that can run it is the expensive piece	1.0 thats not bad. I have a rx 280 
0.0 I had to help my dad move some heavy stuff around this past weekend.	1.0 Moving, is always such a pain. Did it go smoothly at least?
0.0 Yeah.  He kept up with me pretty well.	1.0 That's good, glad he wasn't having too tough a time.
0.0 my neighbor dog is always barking, I can't stand it	1.0 Oh man, I can't stand barking dogs. I wish owners would do something to shut them up. 
0.0 i know the worst part is my bedroom is near the fence and the dog barks all night 	1.0 That can make it so hard to sleep at night. 
0.0 When I was a little girl my favorite childhood character was Strawberry Shortcake. I miss those days smelling my little figurines that smelled like strawberries.	1.0 Aw man, childhood is full of good memories! I love the smell of strawberries. 
0.0 Yeah, I also remember having my strawberry shortcake themed birthday party. There were strawberries everywhere! I bet you could guess what flavor the cake and ice cream were, lol.	1.0 Haha, clearly strawberry. Sounds like you had an enjoyable childhood! 
0.0 my neighbor dog barks all day, I like to go over there and tell him where he can put that dog at, 	1.0 Your neighbor doesn't do anything about his dogs?
0.0 that is the problem, he does nothing, except give me his little mustache smile, one of these days i'll wipe that smile off his face	1.0 If it were me, I'd call the animal shelter and report possible abuse since the dog does nothing but bark all day - poor thing just needs attention and the owner isn't taking care of it.
0.0 I feel so sad to see the world in the state that it is in but I am confident that times are changing and humanity is actually good.	1.0 Really depends on the person I think. You can't have good people without bad people.
0.0 Yes that is true. The ying and the yang. But I think most people are good though.	1.0 Agreed!
0.0 My childhood was great. I have mainly positive memories of it.	1.0 You are very lucky my friend. There are so many children out there that cannot say the same, sadly. But so happy for you!
0.0 Yeah life ends up pretty dark for tons of people. It's slightly absurd when you think far into it!	1.0 I guess it all comes down to karma, if you believe in that stuff...... I do. :)
0.0 I decided to try and get some projects knocked out a couple of nights ago, but needed to keep my kids occupied.	1.0 what did you end up doing?
0.0 Luckily, my wife was willing to keep them busy.  Even after she had a crazy day!	1.0 It's good to have a partner. 
0.0 My wife took the kids over to her mother's one evening before I got home from work.  I thought it'd be pretty nice to have a quiet house for once.	1.0 I have a son, it's definitely nice to have some peace and quiet.
0.0 It was for a while, but it was too quiet for me!  I've gotten used to the noise.	1.0 You must have been very happy when they returned home.
0.0 I tried for a promotion at work recently.  It's been a while since I've gotten a raise, so I worked pretty hard at it.	1.0 Did you get it?
0.0 No, they ended up giving it to someone with less experience.	1.0 That's disappointing. I feel sorry for you. 
0.0 I went to the casino with my brother and the only thing he could do was win! The only thing I could do was lose.	1.0 That sounds like a bummer. Hopefully, you did not lose too much.
0.0 Nope, I'm a little careful when I go out there.  It would have been nice to join in on the winning though!	1.0 Yeah, but it is a good thing to hear you did not lose too much. Some people put all the money on the line.
0.0 I interviewed for a job.  I know I gave great answers to their questions and walked away feeling like the job was mine.	1.0 Hey, that's awesome! I hope you get it. When do you hear?
0.0 Probably next week sometime. I'm really excited!	1.0 Well I hope you do. What kind of job is it?
0.0 I work in tech support.  One issue I was given the details before and got to do research before I worked with the customer.  It was great knowing what to do before it happened.	1.0 You must have been relieved you were able to help. Did all go as plan?
0.0 yeah! I pretty much knew all the steps that I needed to do before everything started and there werent any surprise issues which was awesome.	1.0 That's awesome! I'm glad it went through without a hitch!
0.0 my girlfriend just got promoted at her job. I am really glad for her.	1.0 Oh, that's terrific! What a great feeling that is, to be appreciated and valued!
0.0 i knew she could and would get the promotion, i feel like i am going to burst 	1.0 Oh, I love that you are so happy for her! You sound like such a supportive and loving partner!
0.0 I have been working on potty training my dog and she has been doing great! Last night though she went a TON in the house right after I brought her out.	1.0 I also have two older puppies, training takes time and care and love.
0.0 It definitely does!  I have one older puppy that I got through potty training.  This one is just taking a little extra time.	1.0 Puppies are smart believe it or not, use treats and don't yell or punish for their mistakes. A change of tone and placing them outside works really well.
0.0 I was packing up things to move from my girlfriends house and found her son's lite brite.  It reminded me of my childhood and playing with that toy.	1.0 i remember the lite brite toy. it was a nice toy to have.
0.0 It really was! The toys back then seemed to have lasted a lot longer than the toys now too!	1.0 i agree, the toys now days are made cheaply and of poor quality. everything is about video games. 
0.0 I had a move a couple weekends ago.  I was really planning on getting everything done, or at least moved over, in one weekend.	1.0 Moving can be stressful for sure, hopefully you had some help?
0.0 yeah, the help was great and we did end up getting everything over.  Now the fun part is unpacking the boxes!	1.0 It's like christmas! only you already know whats in the boxes. the best part about moving is you can have a fresh start on organization. 
0.0 I had a great weekend with my son, we did a ton of fun things.  At the end of the weekend his attitude changed and he didnt want to listen at all.	1.0 That's not good!  What did you do to try to get him to listen again?
0.0 I made a deal that if he went to bed he would get tablet time the next day and if he didnt then he wouldnt get any time	1.0 I bet that worked!
0.0 My dog went number 2 in the middle of the night inside.  The next morning she threw up everything...it was the worst smelling pile of stuff I've ever smelled.	1.0 Oh man, i'm about to eat dinner over here! lol that's pretty gross. My cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate.

0.0 I used to have a boxer puppy that was so sweet and adorable.  HOwever he had on issue that I could not stand.	1.0 interesting, what was the issue?
0.0 Well when he was during the potty training stage he would often poop on the floor.   HOwever he would then eat it!!!!!   I could smell it but not find it anywhere.   He would come running into the living room wanting to lick you on the face with poop breath!	1.0 oh man, that is an issue, i hope he grows out of it

0.0 One of my coworkers was outright belligerent today.	1.0 That sucks! What were they upset about?
0.0 I don't even know!  She does that sometimes, and just badgers you.  I can't figure out what fires her up.	1.0 It sounds like a very challenging environment to work in.
0.0 My girlfriend is moving in.  I was pretty calm when we first started talking about it.  I'm really excited but there is so much to pack up!	1.0 That's exciting! When will she be moving in?
0.0 In 2 weeks.  It'll come up fast, I think thats why I'm starting to get a little more nervous.  Its not even her, its just the move that will not be fun	1.0 Does she live far away?
0.0 My wife and I are trying to build a house, and keep running into delays getting the permits.	1.0 That sounds very frustrating.
0.0 It is!  The guy at the city could care less if he helps us out.	1.0 Hopefully you'll able to get it all sorted out soon.  I'm sure when it's done it'll be a beautiful house.
0.0 I was home alone last night playing a VR game.  It took a really creepy turn that I really wasnt expecting at all.	1.0 What happened?
0.0 It was a duck hunting game and all of a sudden the dog from the game killed my mom and started coming after me.  I dont know if you've ever tried VR but everything feels SO real.  It was pretty scary	1.0 I've never tried VR, but just imagining that is scaring me away from it.
0.0 a job I applied and interview for a couple of months ago offered me the job. It was unexpected.	1.0 Congrats!  How exciting for you.
0.0 thank you, when they called, I did not know who it was at first, then it was, wow I got the job	1.0 That's a long time to hold out hope.  I bet you were shocked.
0.0 My husband, I think you've met him, he's been having a hard time finding a job recently. He's been in the final two candidates THREE times but no luck!	1.0 It always takes time. Hang in there It will all work out.
0.0 Well, he's got another interview on Thursday. I just know he will get that one!	1.0 I bet so too!  Good luck to you both.
0.0 i needed help with choosing a subject to major and my brother helped	1.0 What subject did you choose?
0.0 I chose finance and economics	1.0 Nice choice. I guess you have good relationship with your brother.
0.0 I felt ashamed seeing the police officer yelling at the old lady	1.0 why was the officer yelling at her?
0.0 She was trying to cross the road and accidentally had her phone fall, the officer thought she was insane	1.0 wow, that's unfortunate. i would feel embarrassed for the lady
0.0 My mother has been a caring mom since i got ill a week ago	1.0 That's so wonderful. I love being cared for when I am ill.
0.0 Yah, i feel loved so much	1.0 It is an amazing thing to have a loving mother. Everyone should show more appreciation to their moms.
0.0 I had to walk home from work last night after I got off late at night, it was kind of scary.	1.0 Sorry about that, you could have taken a taxi
0.0 It was a short enough walk, I just stayed aware of my surroundings and got home safe.	1.0 good enough you got home safe
0.0 Today I was looking through my childhood photos and writings, it made me a little emotional and nostalgic.	1.0 Did you have a good childhood? You must miss a lot of things.
0.0 I think I had a good childhood. I love that I have many photos that I ca look back on.	1.0 Yes. Nostalgia is unavoidable when we look back on our youth.
0.0 I slept through a really important class because I was hungover and I failed because of it. I should've behaved better.	1.0 That's unfortunate. But at least you learned from the experience, right?
0.0 I sure did. I am just embarrassed that I did that, I am not usually that way. It was out of character for me.	1.0 No need to feel ashamed. We all make mistakes and at least you learned your lesson.
0.0 I had to care for my younger brother last week while he was sick. I tried my best to make him as comfortable as possible. 	1.0 That's nice that you helped him. I'm sure he appreciated it!
0.0 He did, he is nice and well now. I just know how horrible it is to be sick, it helps to have someone to care for you.	1.0 Yes, it really does. I am sure if you get sick, he will remember and do the same for you!
0.0 I once got in a really bad accident on my way home from work and it really upset me	1.0 Wow! Were you hurt? Was anyone else hurt?
0.0 luckily the only problem I had was my neck was sore for a few weeks but nobody else was hurt	1.0 That's good news at least. I hope you are feeling better now. And don't be hard on yourself, accidents happen.
0.0 Hi! I had a great day with my emotions with my child going to school!	1.0 Oh that's great, its awesome when the kids go off to school each year.
0.0 Yes - this is m child's first year and it was pretty difficult for me to let someone take care of him instead of me. You know how it is! Parent life.	1.0 You'll get used to it and begin to appreciate your quiet time, haha.
0.0 I just had a weird experience at Wal-Mart today!	1.0 Wal-Mart is a place where weirdness always happens. Can you tell me what happened, I'm dying to know!
0.0 Well, I was parked pretty close and a guy came up to ask me for gas money!  There was a gas station a small walk away though!	1.0 Do you think he was panhandling you for money or a person who really needed it? Did you give him money?
0.0 I'm going to cut to the chase here. Just blurt it on. My DRESS blew up in front of parents and children the other day when it was windy.	1.0 That must have been a very windy day!
0.0 I wanted to run and hide.  I haven't' worn a dress since.  	1.0 I bet It will teach you.
0.0 i felt great last year when i started going to church again	1.0 I go to church every Sunday I love it.
0.0 yeah its a great feeling getting back into church !	1.0 The people you can meet are super.
0.0 I felt very grateful last week when an elderly women paid for my gas 	1.0 That
0.0 Yeah its nice when people do kind things like this it doesn't happen very often now day	1.0 That is really not thing. I wish more people would do such nice thing. I know that made your day.
0.0 When I lived on my own, I found it hard without having any company	1.0 So you don't like to be alone. I am so sorry that affects you. So what would you do? 
0.0 I was used to having family or friends around most of the time in my old place, but then I moved away. I had to make new friends which I found very difficult	1.0 Yes, usually when one relocates it's hard to make new friends, but eventually it will happen.
0.0 I eventually made friends through work, and it is really nice when my old friends come to visit too 	1.0 That was really nice of your old friends.
0.0 I love the gifts that i received last week on my birthday	1.0 Happy birthday. What was your favorite gift?
0.0 A pair of shoe	1.0 Nice. What brand of shoes were they?
0.0 I felt a bit sad last week when i saw an elderly man drop his wallet and a kid picked it up and didn't give it back to the man	1.0 That's terrible. Were you able to identify the kid?
0.0 Yeah eventually the kid was caught i told the man and he caught him shortly after	1.0 I'm glad he was able to catch him.
0.0 I saw the movie trailer about Paul Walker's life today. It made me so sad!	1.0 Wow, how was it? I have never seen that trailer. 
0.0 It was just sad. I love Paul Walker and his movies. I still remember hearing about him passing away in the same way he became famous. In a fast car.	1.0 Aww, that is so sad to hear. He must have made some great movies! 
0.0 Speaking of babies, I got to meet my nephews yesterday!	1.0 Are they twins?!
0.0 Yes!  They are so sweet. I don't even like kids and I really felt my heart warm up to them.	1.0 Awww! Twins seem like a handful but also very exciting at the same time!
0.0 The other day something happened that made me want to run and hide.	1.0 Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?
0.0 It didn't happen to me directly, but my husband passed GAS while we were shopping. Everyone was staring.	1.0 I can imagine that you did want to run and hide. Sometimes husbands get us into all kinds of situations.
0.0 My girlfriend and I were watching a series on Netflix.  She wasnt home and I ended up watching a couple episodes ahead of where we were at.	1.0 I've been in that situation before. Did she find out about it? 
0.0 She didnt say anything but I think she knew.  I mean, I still watched the episodes that she missed with her!	1.0 Well that's all that matters. If she was okay with it. I'm sure she was happy watching the episodes with you, even if you had already watched them. 
0.0 I moved last weekend.  I was really happy once everything was done and it went smoothly.	1.0 That sounds like a bit of work. Are you adjusting to your place now?
0.0 Yeah, unpacking and all that fun stuff now.  I really like the new place though.	1.0 That's what's most important. I'm glad everything has gone well.
0.0 I'm not in a good mood! My husband got to go to a basketball game. I wish I could have too!	1.0 Oh, I'm sorry. Why didn't you get to go with him?
0.0 I have to stay home with our son.  It is hard for us to find a baby sitter for him.	1.0 Oh, that's too bad. I know exactly how you feel. Hopefully your husband will watch your son another night so you can go have some fun. 
0.0 I went to a friend's wedding this weekend!	1.0 Was it a lot of fun?
0.0 Oh gosh yes. I wore a beautiful dress. I felt so pretty!	1.0 That's great, but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!
0.0 Thank you! I feel like a slob lately.	1.0 It's ok, just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.
0.0 it is nice to have a loving pet , My dog is always there for me	1.0 What a great feeling! You must love your dog.
0.0 i really do, no matter what happens, she will always be by my side	1.0 She sounds like a great companion.
0.0 Hello! I started my graduate classes today.	1.0 Are you looking forward to it?
0.0 Yes. I have all my binders ready with paper and a calendar to keep track of stuff.  I'm nervous but ready!	1.0 Exciting! I'm sure you'll do fine.
0.0 I really need to change doctors!	1.0 Why is that?
0.0 He keeps screwing up my prescription!  I've needed it for a week now but they keep sending it to the wrong place or use the wrong name	1.0 Wow, that's no good. I hope they get it worked out soon.
0.0 I was playing a VR game home alone.  It took a really creepy turn towards the end of the game.	1.0 I can't play those kinds of games. Too spooky for me.
0.0 It didnt start off scary but out of nowhere everyone around me was dying and I was home alone with a killer outside the house.  It all just feels so real in VR too.	1.0 That would keep me up at night.
0.0 yesterday i ate a whole big bag of M&Ms, i don't feel proud of myself	1.0 Oh my gosh that's insane. Well, I'm sure you'll be able to control your impulses in the future. 
0.0 i hope so, i was doing so well on my diet but I feel like I failed	1.0 I've been there before too. The important thing to remember is that there is always another chance to make it right tomorrow. 
0.0 We recently got a new puppy. My older dog waits his turn and knows the puppy should go outside to the bathroom first.	1.0 Aww, sounds like he is teaching the puppy. That's so sweet.
0.0 It is pretty awesome!  I'm impressed that he knows he doesnt need to be first and the puppy should have priority.	1.0 Yeah, sounds like a pretty smart pup.
0.0 We've been really struggling with potty training my son.	1.0 I do understand, I have a son myself. You just need to be patient and continue trying.
0.0 Thanks, we are.  He did finally go #2 in the toilet by himself last night, though!	1.0 That is awesome. I am proud of him 
0.0 I went out with some friends a couple weekends ago and we met a group of girls. One asked for my number but I told her I have a girlfriend and didnt give it out.	1.0 gotta risk it for the biscuit
0.0 Haha, I dont think I could do that to my girlfriend.  I like her too much for a random chick.	1.0  i feel ya but sometimes temptation is good gets the heart pumping
0.0 i have a presentation due this week, I am not looking forward to presenting it in front of others	1.0 It can be nerve wrecking. I'm sure you will do fine, though! Have confidence!
0.0 i feel like i know the material but i am not sure if i can pull it off in front of others	1.0 You know they say, imagine them in their underwear...I wonder that really works. I'm not fond of public speaking either.
0.0 I felt very bad when my boss did not approve of my work. It just makes me more motivated to work harder.	1.0 Did you spend a lot of the time on the project?
0.0 Yes, I feel like I worked really hard and I put in so many hours. I guess it was not good enough. :(	1.0 I wouldnt get discouraged.  Maybe talk to your boss and see what you can improve on next time.  I'm sure, at least if you have a good boss, they will want you to succeed and guide you in how to do better.
0.0 My roommate moved out and soon my girlfriend will move in but right now it is just me in the house. I dont remember the last time I lived without any roommates.	1.0 Nice! Enjoy it! I like living alone. It is so peaceful! I get lonely somtimes but for the most part it is great!
0.0 It does feel a little lonely.  It's weird coming home and not really having someone to talk to in person.	1.0 Yeah, but they are all just a phone call away. Keep your head up, your girlfriend will be there soon!
0.0 I feel so happy when the sunsets are beautiful and I can take the time to watch and relax. It is the best time of the day for me.	1.0 Oh I know, mine too! I love how all the colors change with the setting sun.
0.0 Yeah, it is such a good time to reflect and meditate on life and stop to enjoy the beauty of this world.	1.0 It reminds you of how beautiful life is.
0.0 Man the new guys at work were slandering our boss so bad.	1.0 Wow, that's rude! He won't last long...
0.0 I know right?  I made sure to keep my mouth shut and not add on to what they were saying or doing.	1.0 Yeah, some nerve on that guy. He should be grateful to have a job!
0.0 My sister is having another baby! I can't wait to meet her! This will be her fourth child.	1.0 Oh wow! Congrats!! How exciting!! How far along is she?
0.0 Only one more month to go. She is about the explode though! Glad it is her and not me, lol.	1.0 LOL Right!!! It's way too hot to be pregnant right now!
0.0 Totally agree! But I will be there to fan my sister for her at least. Haha	1.0 You are so awesome!!! I wish I had  sister like you when I was pregnant.
0.0 There was a random dog in my yard yesterday morning.  He didn't look mean but I wasn't sure I wanted to mess with him.	1.0 I've been in that situation before!  It can be scary
0.0 It was!  I didn't want to chase him off either.  Thankfully he just kind of wandered away.	1.0 I'm glad it worked out in the end!  I wish people would be more careful with their dogs.
0.0 I bought something from the store and the lady gave me the wrong change. She gave me too much change actually. I did not realize until later after I left the store.	1.0 Oh, no. Did you take it back or keep it
0.0 I have not had time to go back yet but I will for sure. I feel bad like as if I did something wrong. I better check my change from now on.	1.0 The store might not take it back at this point if it has been to long. 
0.0 So I was driving down the road the other day and passed that stretch of road that has all those mimosa trees.  They were in bloom and man did they stir up some emotions.	1.0 That sounds beautiful! What emotions did they bring out of you?
0.0 My grandmother kept those trees at our old house.  They super made me miss her and when we used to sit outside on her porch.	1.0 I'm sorry! What a lovely memory to have of her though. It's good to still have things in your life that remind you of her.
0.0 So I lost the ring that my best friend gave me when he moved out of country.  We had matching ones made and it's really breaking my heart.	1.0 Oh no! That's so sad. I'm so sorry, I know you must feel like crap.
0.0 It's strange sometimes how we get so attached to material things like this.  I know I really shouldn't but it feels like a piece of me is gone.	1.0 I understand completely. I have things of my grandfather's that I can never replace.
0.0 We had a pretty fun family vacation about a month ago.	1.0 Sweet! Where did you go?
0.0 We went to a lake not far from here.  We had a ton of fun on the boat . . . nobody else was on the water one of the days!	1.0 That would be awesome to have the whole lake to yourself! My guess is the weather was nice too if you guys got to use the boat most days!
0.0 I work in tech support.  Every once in a while a customer will want our software to do something it either cant or is not built for.	1.0 I've had similar experiences.  What do you end up doing?
0.0 I write up feedback for development. It just gets frustrating when they start to demand that I fix it.  I might be good at my job but not good enough to do a code change on the fly.	1.0 Have you ever had a positive experience from that cycle?
0.0 I had to take my dog to the vet yesterday and I had full confidence they would take care of his problems. They are so good there.	1.0 oh no! hope all is well with your dog.
0.0 Thank you. Other than an allergic reaction and a subsequent skin infection all is well. Just a couple weeks of meds and a change in diet needed.	1.0 Good to read. Always great to find a vet you can trust. Looks like you did. 
0.0 So we went out to that new BBQ place to eat the other night.  	1.0 BBQ sounds so good right now! How was it?
0.0 It wasn't bad.  It wasn't earth shattering good either.  Everything just weirdly seemed okay.  It was a bit strange. 	1.0 Well that's kind of disappointing. It's always a let down when you go out and it isn't is good as you were hoping.
0.0 I really loathe meetings.  They're usually so pointless.	1.0 i completely agree. though, i'm remote so i am never sitting in the same room as others so i can distract myself ;)
0.0 That must be nice . . . I'm in person.  However, I actually had a productive meeting this morning.  How novel that was!	1.0 lol. it kinda is. i moved about 3 hours south of my office a few years ago and since even at the office my work involves connecting to remote data centers it hasn't changed my job any. 
0.0 Oh man.  I was at the store yesterday and my nose just started bleeding like crazy!	1.0 That's terrible! What did you do?
0.0 I had to bolt out of the store!  I have never been so embarrassed.  Lucky for me I had a napkin in my purse so I didn't get it everywhere.	1.0 That's good. I'm glad your alright.
0.0 Once in Kindergarten, a pair of my underwear got stuck in my shirt and fell out in the middle of the classroom.	1.0 Oh no! That's so sad. You must've been so upset. 
0.0 I was! I thought I was going to get in trouble	1.0 Hopefully you didn't and hopefully the other kids didn't make fun of you
0.0 the other day I was looking at old pictures of a car i use to own. I miss that car.	1.0 What kind of car was it?
0.0 i was an old Cadillac, reason I miss it, lot of memories of family and friends riding in it	1.0 Oh I bet! My husband wants an older car when we can afford it
0.0 i just lost my pet dog. I do not know what to do.	1.0 OH NO! I would be devastated. Did he pass, or missing?
0.0 i cannot find her anywhere, she is missing, it feels like I have a part of me missing 	1.0 I am so sorry. I am sure you are. I would be devastated if I was in your shoes. Does she have a chip? Maybe someone will get her to a vet office.
0.0 It was wonderful not having to worry about my most recent exam, knowing I was prepared.	1.0 Good job! How do you think you did on it?
0.0 I know I did well! I studied and felt very prepared when I took it.	1.0 That is a good feeling. Time to celebrate before the grind starts all over!
0.0 I packed for a long road trip, and had everything I would need to hopefully avoid excessive stops. 	1.0 Yeah I like going straight to the point too
0.0 Definitely. Nothing worse than dragging out a drive because you didn't pack enough food and didn't plan bathroom breaks.	1.0 I like when I get places earlier than expected
0.0 I had a dentist appointment yesterday.  I hate going to the dentist!	1.0 I understand that completely! Did you have to get any work done?
0.0 Yes I had to get a filling in my very back tooth.  THe dentist said I had a very deep cavity and to raise my hand if I started to feel anything because it was very close to my nerve.   I was scared the whole time.	1.0 That sounds scary! I always avoid going to the dentist until I absolutely have to. I know that's pretty bad!
0.0 My son wouldnt sleep last night.  He kept yelling and wouldnt go into his room.	1.0 Oh no! I hate when that happens. Was he afraid or just didn't want to sleep?
0.0 He just didnt want to sleep. I think he was overtired and trying to fight it at that point.	1.0 Ugh, that's the worst. That happens a lot with my son as well. Hopefully he wasn't too cranky today!
0.0 My son graduated pre-school.  It isnt much but its that next step in his school career.	1.0 That is wonderful! You must be happy, shows that he is getting bigger, soon it will be college 
0.0 Haha, I hope not too soon!  I was really happy, he is growing pretty fast!	1.0 College is when the tear will start to flow. I love children.
0.0 I'm going to a beer dabbler this weekend.  It has been very busy the last couple weeks so I'm really looking forward to drinking and relaxing this weekend.	1.0 That will be fun. What a great way to relax and unwind
0.0 I think so.  I'm hoping the weather will be nice and we can all have a great time!	1.0 I saw the weather forecast. We only have a 20% chance of rain so you know how it is here. We'll be good.
0.0 I'm trying to transition my dog into not sleeping in my room.  I know he wants to be by me and I can hear him whining and scratching at the door some nights	1.0 That must be hard to do, he wants to be beside you. He is going to miss you.
0.0 I know.  It's tough to hear but he needs to be a little more independent and sleep in his own bed too!	1.0 Yes he needs to so you would have to ignore him at nights.
0.0 i do love my pet doggy, she is a treat to have	1.0 That is so sweet. What is her name?
0.0 Angie, i like to give her a warm bath, dress her in her doggy clothes and give her a doggy treat	1.0 I can just imagine she sleeps in your bed sometimes. I love dogs, I would like to have a dog someday.
0.0 We just got a new puppy.  My older dog knew to let that one out first when I got home from work.	1.0 That is very cute, the little one probably couldn't hold its bladder as long. 
0.0 Definitely not.  I was surprised that he knew to let the little one go first!	1.0 That was very smart of him, maybe he remembers back to his puppy days.
0.0 I used to have my dog in his crate when I left for work.  Lately I have been letting him out more and more in the house when I've been gone.	1.0 That's good. How is it going?
0.0 It's going well!  So far no accidents and he doesnt appear to have ruined anything.	1.0 That's great news! It sounds like he is enjoying his new freedom, and was ready for it. 
0.0 I was driving down the road and I almost hit a dog! I was so close. Really scary!	1.0 I'm glad you didn't hit the dog!  Did he jump out at you suddenly?
0.0 Yes, he came out of nowhere and I slammed on my brakes. My tires skid across the road.	1.0 I live out in a rural area where people don't always have control of their dogs.  Sometimes those little ankle-biting dogs will start chasing the car and they make a break for the car and it makes one really fearful that you'll hit them.
0.0 I finished all the ice cream when I was told to leave some for others. I was just so hungry!	1.0 lol, guess you were pretty hungry
0.0 Yeah, now I am scared somebody will find out. I better go buy some more before anyone gets home. Haha	1.0 yeah, might wanna go replace it
0.0 I am the happiest in my life when I am at the ocean. There is just something so special about nature at the ocean for me.	1.0 That sounds amazing. What's your favorite beach to go to?
0.0 I don't really have a favorite. They are all my favorite! But I prefer the beaches that have perfect soft sand with no rocks or anything. Like a huge swimming pool! 	1.0 Those are the best. Especially the white sand crystal clear water beaches.
0.0 I saw Dubai from the airplane one day. I never went into the city, but wow, it was a sight to see!	1.0 i sure it was beautiful
0.0 It looked like another planet or something. Very sci-fi. Almost scary actually.	1.0 really, i wouldve never thought that. i have a friend who is in Dubai on a teaching assignment
0.0 I found out that my neighbors eat turtle meat. How gross!!!	1.0 yuck, how gross!!
0.0 Yeah, who does that? I have three pet turtles so I better keep a good watch on them. lol	1.0 lol right, they could easily be your neighbors dinner
0.0 I felt very sad recently when i found out that my mother has cancer 	1.0 Oh my gosh, I am so sorry for your family.
0.0 Thank you .  Shes a fighter i hope she can push through 	1.0 I'm sure she can with all the technology and modern medicine now. She's got this!!
0.0 I don't have many friends and my family lives very far away. I sometimes feel very sad.	1.0 why do you live so far from family
0.0 It is just where I ended up in life. You know one thing leads to another and your living a whole knew life.	1.0 i would like a new life. i totally understand
0.0 I heard a really loud bang in the middle of the night. the next morning I found out that it was gun shots. OMG	1.0 what? that scary
0.0 Someone was grabbed from their home and brought out to the street and was shot in the foot. Guess they wanted to teach him a lesson.	1.0 wow, a hard lesson
0.0 My internet connection keeps breaking! How am I going to get all my work done?	1.0 I understand!  I live in the country and have the same problem.
0.0 It always happens when there are electrical storms. It seems to be storm season around here.	1.0 Yes.  The only company available out here is Century Link and they just crash randomly all the time.
0.0 I feel very blessed that I have been able to live around the world my whole life. Now I am settled in one place for awhile.	1.0 That is very cool. What took you all around the world? What was your favourite place?
0.0 My father was in the military so I lived all over the world my first 20 years of life. My favorite place is Spain.	1.0 What interesting stories you must have! I think that would be really neat, but settling down is probably good too. 
0.0 My guinea pig had 5 babies but all of them died. I don't know why...	1.0 That is so sad.  I hate it when pets die.
0.0 Yeah, it is terrible. I just wish I knew why but oh well. She will have more babies in a couple months. 	1.0 yes.  they do like to have lots of  babies
0.0 Hello!	1.0 I am going on a trip to Peru to visit Machu Picchu! I can't sleep because of the anticipation!
0.0 WOW im so jealous! You lucky dog.	1.0 I hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history.

0.0 Right now I am really enjoying Mr. Robot. I've never seen The Office but I always hear wonderful things about it.	1.0 I have never heard of Mr. Robot actually.

0.0 My dog just had a baby and I did not even know she was pregnant! What!!	1.0 A puppy!  That's so exciting!  Are you going to keep it?
0.0 I am not sure yet. I already have 4 dogs. I want to because he is so cute!	1.0 I don't know that I would be able to give it up.  4 is a lot, but what's one more?
0.0 My boyfriend is going out with a bunch of people I don't know tonight. But I trust him that he will be a good boy.	1.0 Well I'm sure he will be, most guys are. I'd never get to  do anything if my girlfriend didn't trust me.
0.0 Yeah. I was in a bad relationship before with a man that was extremely untrustworthy so sometimes I get a bit crazy sometimes. 	1.0 Everyone gets jealous, It when you act on unfounded stuff that is the issue.
0.0 I get so upset when someone does not agree with what I am doing. I am a grown women and feel I can make good choices for myself.	1.0 Yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong
0.0 Yes, it is like they don't have a life of their own and want to control others lives. 	1.0 Yes.  Especially men who want to mansplain things to you.
0.0 By brother won a scratch off sticker lottery ticket! He is giving most of it to charity.	1.0 Wow!  How much did he win?
0.0 He won like $40, 000. He is a good man to give it all away to a good cause.	1.0 That is awesome that he gave it away!  Maybe good karma will let him win again.
0.0 I was driving the other day and my gas tank was super low. I thought I could make it to school in time but decided that running out of gas was the bigger problem.	1.0 Good choice. You could have broken down and never made it to school.
0.0 Yeah so true. The funny thing is as I was driving into the gas station my car started to stall because of having zero gas. lol	1.0 HAHA! You are super lucky you are smart. Lol
0.0 Very often I get very emotional when things go wrong. I think more emotional than most people.	1.0 Everyone handles stress differently. My anxiety gets so High I sometimes cancel my plans.
0.0 I know it is not healthy for the body to get so stressed out but I just can't help it. Maybe I need a therapist.	1.0 I go to a psychiatrist and take meds, It just fixes what your body doesn't make, or do properly. It helps so much. 
0.0 I made a stupid mistake at work and I got fired. What am I going to do?	1.0 Oh no! It will be ok. It seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once. Everyone gets through it!
0.0 Yeah, I feel really bad though. It is such a terrible feeling to be rejected like that.	1.0 Sometimes you need those times to make your realize how special having a job is. Gives you perspective.
0.0 My son was very sick a few weeks ago, enough that he had to go to the hospital! I was nervous about what the doctor would have to say but had faith that he would help my son get better. 	1.0 I hope everything is fine, How did it turn out?
0.0 It turned out fine in the end. I knew the doctor would do what he thought was best - and my son did get better!	1.0 Im happy to hear that, a sick child is always a scary thing.
0.0 I am going on a trip next month and I'm really excited about it	1.0 Neat. Where are you going?
0.0 We are driving to Florida to visit family. It will be a long drive but that's a part of the fun.	1.0 Sounds exciting. Have fun.
0.0 My friend just got a new car and it's the same car I've been wanting ever since it came out	1.0 Oh wow, are you feeling super envious?
0.0 You bet I am! I told him I was driving my car whenever we go out because I don't want to see it, lol.	1.0 Ha ha, I don't blame you! Hopefully you can get the car you want soon though.
0.0 My dog has been really sick this past week but after going to the vet I truly think he will be just fine	1.0 I 'm glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it?
0.0 He want really weak and had a fever. It was because of an allergy that gave him a severe skin infection.	1.0 I 'm glad you was able to pin point the problem and I hope he stays in good health.
0.0 at work I kept on hearing people laughing behind me, when I got to my desk, my coworker pointed out a postage stamp was stuck on back of my head	1.0 Wow, that's so mean of them to laugh at you! At least someone pointed it out eventually, right? 
0.0 yeah, but i think my boss even seen it too, i wanted to hide under my desk	1.0 That's embarrasing. But hey, I think the best way to get over moments like those is to just laugh at yourself! Don't beat yourself up for it. 
0.0 My cousin has the perfect life, sometimes I am envious of her.	1.0 Wonderful I bet she is really content if everything is perfect. Love to hear that someone is doing well.
0.0 I do too, I just wish I had her life at times.	1.0 I understand but try not to be jealous. Good things will come to you to in its own time
0.0 i applied for a job promotion. But i won't know if i got it or not until next week	1.0 The waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking.
0.0 i know, im having trouble concentrating at work, I just want to know right now	1.0 Things like that make me antsy.
0.0 After my haircut last week, I have received so many nice compliments!	1.0 A new haircut can do wonders! I always feel like a million bucks after.
0.0 I wasn't too sure about it but all the lovely compliments really made me feel good! 	1.0 I bet you looked great! Those compliments would've made me feel good too!
0.0 I was just reminiscing with my mother about my childhood.	1.0 Oh? What specifically were you talking to her about?
0.0 My aspirations when I was younger. We had a good laugh when I read in one of my old journals that I wanted to be a teacher when earlier that day I had stated that I couldn't imagine being a teacher now.	1.0 Haha! Well, as we mature, we learn so much more about ourselves.
0.0 I went to Six FLags once with my daughters.   I didnt want to go as I hate to ride roller coasters and am scared of heights.	1.0 Haha you are a good father. I hope you can make it through it!
0.0 I am a mother not a father silly.  Yes I made it through all right, but thought I was going to die!!   THey had me ride the ferris wheel and I was crying as they were laughing at me.	1.0 Oh my gosh! I'm sorry! haha Thats funny. Atleast you have them a story to always remember.;)
0.0 Today before work when I went to brush my teeth, there was no toothpaste left. My boyfriend used it all!	1.0 Oh no! So what did you do?!
0.0 I was so angry, I had to leave for work very soon. I ended up just asking a neighbor to borrow some. I didn't have anytime to buy any before work. I couldn't afford to be late.	1.0 That's nice of your neighbor! Your boyfriend should've told you that there was no toothpaste earlier. Maybe there would've been time to get some. But at least you didn't go to work with stinky breath, right?
0.0 I once had a party when I was a teenager.  My parents were out of town.	1.0 Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?
0.0 Sure can!   Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol, so needless to say we were all drunk.   We attempted to play darts.   Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall.  THe house was trashed when my parents returned.  Years later I feel bad about it still.	1.0 Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.
0.0 i envy my sister, she is going on vacation in Paris	1.0 Wow, cool. Maybe you can ask to tag along?
0.0 I will be at work, maybe next time	1.0 That's too bad. Well, at least you have something to work towards and plan as a goal for yourself.
0.0 My litthe sister read out the speech in my graduation party	1.0 That's amazing! How old is she?
0.0 she is 9	1.0 Wow, that must've been a big thing for both of you.
0.0 I will be sitting for my nclex exam on friday	1.0 I am sorry I do not know what nclex is but I wish you good luck
0.0 Its a nursing exam, thank you	1.0 O ok I hope that everything works out for you 
0.0 One time there was a stray cat hiding from a dog in my front door	1.0 Wow! Did you try to get it out?
0.0 Yup, I adopted it and he's my pet now!	1.0 That's amazing! He probably loves you so much
0.0 i was upset at myself for sleeping in so late this morning	1.0 Do you feel nice and refreshed though?
0.0 yes definitely!	1.0 I did the same thing today, so you are not alone in your behavior friend!
0.0 I dropped my iPod touch on the bathroom floor.	1.0 Oh no! Did it break?
0.0 Unfortunately yes. The screen shattered and I went for over a month without music.	1.0 Oh, that really stinks. I hope you were able to get another one.
0.0 My guinea pig was feeling very sick but I was able to nurse her back to health.	1.0 Did you do some neat doctor stuff on it?
0.0 No, I hate giving chemical medicine to my animals. I just kept her on a heating blanket and gave her lots of fresh veggies. She is alright now!	1.0 Oh yea that sounds like you did a good job!
0.0 After training my dog I feel confident now that he can be around others dogs without fighting.	1.0 That is good, how long did it take before you go him to this point?
0.0 It took about a month. I think it was quicker but I was just too nervous to bring him around others dogs to find out.	1.0 Yeah i understand, it is good that you took him there though
0.0 my next door neighbor just bought a Mercedes, I wish i can have one.	1.0 Wow they must be doing well. Why dont you try to get one?
0.0 really cannot afford one, but the neighbor can, he is always buying expensive stuff, last month he bought a speed boat.	1.0 sounds wasteful to me. life isnt about material things anyway. 
0.0 Last week I had a argument with my son, he really said some mean things to me. I thought I raised him better.	1.0 Yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment
0.0 It really hurt my feelings. I wish he would've handled it better. I'm more disappointed in him lashing out rather than what he said.	1.0 well maybe you guys should talk
0.0 My roommate cooked some really foul smelling meat last night, I had to leave or I was going to puke.	1.0 Ugh my neighbors do that sometimes. It's the worst! I think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone.
0.0 Exactly! I had to air out the place for a couple hours after.	1.0 Ick. Hopefully the smell is fully gone now
0.0 I used the restroom at a nice restaurant and I had toilet paper stuck to my shoe and didn't know it until I left. 	1.0 Oh that is the worst feeling! I hate using the restroom in public as is. 
0.0 Yeah, I wish someone told me at least. They all probably just laughed. Haha	1.0 Maybe.  For me I just don't want to cause a stranger to be embarassed lol
0.0 I am probably one of the few people in the world that looks forward to winter coming.	1.0 I am with you, i like it a lot more than summer personally
0.0 I can get so much work done indoor and the beauty outside is wonderful. I love winter clothes and all the winter holidays.	1.0 I feel that, I hate being hot. In the winter I can be comfy and I can always just put on a jacket if I get too cold, but in the summer it is not that easy.
0.0 When you took your driver's test were you nervous?	1.0 I was very nervous. I did not know if I would pass or not.
0.0 I took mine last summer I was nervous also. My heat was racing the whole time. I was so anxious!	1.0 Did you pass the test?
0.0 Sometimes I feel envious of those that have money than I do.	1.0 I am the same way, I barely make anything compared to a lot of people I know
0.0 Yeah, and it seems so hard to make money these days, at least for me. Maybe I should move to the city where there are more opportunities.	1.0 I think cities are more expensive, like living costs, so I do not want to live there ether personally
0.0 i believed my friend would return my cell phone to me in time	1.0 I'm assuming that he/she didn't return it in time. I'm sorry.
0.0 i accidentally left it at his house and had to message him on facebook and ask him if he could drive it over	1.0 Oh, I understand. Did it bring it to you at all?
0.0 I am as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow that I will get this job promotion!	1.0 That is amazing!  I'm really happy for you!
0.0 Thank you! I have worked so hard for so many years and finally it shows that someone paid attention. :)	1.0 It sounds like you really deserve it!
0.0 Last week I almost got into a car accident, I was terrified. 	1.0 that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?
0.0 I am but I still think about how things could've been so much different right now if I hadn't swerved just at the right moment.	1.0 at least your ok, thank god for that
0.0 there is an upcoming promotion at my job, I am sure i'm going to get it.	1.0 Nice, for what position
0.0 as a supervisor. I feel that all of my hard work and skill has given me the inside track for this position	1.0 That's pretty great, you must really take the initiative.  Good job
0.0 I have all my ingredients for my dinner party and now I am getting ready to prepare a feast!	1.0 You're much braver than me. I would never host a dinner party.. don't feel like I'm good at planning, and don't feel like I'm interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people.
0.0 Yeah, we all have different personalities. But you would come to a dinner party if invited, right?	1.0 I think, maybe, yeah! It depends on who's there, and if I felt comfortable with the host. If I felt like I had enough people to kind of "rescue me" and who I could talk to at the party if I got anxious and couldn't talk to strangers, then that'd be alright. Other than that, I just kind of do like maybe a group of 4, max
0.0 I broke one of my mom's crystal figurine, I tried hard not to tell her but in the end I felt so bad I had to tell her.	1.0 Aw, that's too bad. You did the right thing by telling her though.
0.0 Yes, she didn't even get mad. I still felt so guilty about it though. 	1.0 Maybe you could save up and purchase her a new one.
0.0 I feel happy to know that God has got my back and I don't have to worry about anything.	1.0 I am right there with you!  God is good and wow, He's been with me through so much hardship.  I'm so happy you feel the same way.
0.0 Oh yes. He is there within all of us and he is the greatest friend we will ever have! He will never let us down. Even when we think He has we should only think it is something that I need to learn and He is so caring that He wants to teach me.	1.0 Yes, we can always count on Him to know the bigger picture and have faith that He's working for our good.  Hope you have a blessed day!
0.0 I miss how we all used to celebrate Christmas when I was a child. It was such a warm and cozy time. Things are really changing in this high tech modern world.	1.0 They really have changed. I know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time.
0.0 Yeah, so you remember all those wonderful old Christmas movies and all those commercials they played in between. I still have some videos of recordings from the 80's. 	1.0 Those were awesome! My favorite was the coke commercial at Christmas time. So many memories!
0.0 In July, I found a large moth inside a cottage that my brother and friends were staying at.	1.0 Oh fun!  How big was it about?  Did it have neat markings on it?
0.0 It was as big as a small bird, I was super surprised. It was furry and white all over. I caught it with a cup and let it outside so it can live on!	1.0 I think I saw someone post a picture of those online. Maybe it was a lunar moth! What a fun experience!
0.0 My sister gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby girl last week! I was so happy to meet my niece.	1.0 What is your nieces name?
0.0 Amelia, she makes my heart so happy!	1.0 That's amazing, was it your sisters first baby?
0.0 I planted a whole bunch of flower bushes this year. I cannot wait until next spring when my entire garden will be in bloom with so many wonderful colors and smells.	1.0 It will be amazing!  I should do that too!
0.0 Yes! I just went to the local nursery and they had so many plants to choose from. I made sure to only choose the ones that had some kind of fragrant smell. I am dreaming of all the flower arrangements I will make next year.	1.0 That sounds so great!   I hope your plants grow beautifully!
0.0 After feeling depressed for days, I took the time to sit outside in the sun and have a nice chit chat with my mom.	1.0 That sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down. Getting out in the sun and outside the house/bed is so good.  I'm sorry you're struggling with depression.  I understand.
0.0 Thank you for your kind words, it means a lot really. And yeah the cool breeze felt so comforting, it completely changed my mood!	1.0 I am so glad!  You know what to do to help your body and mind and that is good self-care.  I try to do that as well as meditate and pray in the morning.  Really refocuses me.  I'm glad you're feeling better!
0.0 There may be a hurricane in my area soon I am kind of scared.	1.0 I imagine, are you prepared for it?
0.0 Not yet, but I will start preparing. I am worried we may lose power or our house may flood.	1.0 Oh yes, last year with huracan Irma we went without power for 5 days.
0.0 i felt nostalgiac going through old childhood belongings	1.0 Aw, did it bring back a lot of good memories for you?
0.0 yes definitely, it was great	1.0 That's awesome. Sometimes I wish I could be back in my childhood. Maybe if only for a day. ha ha.
0.0 i forgot to pay my credit card bill, I'm so disappointed with myself.	1.0 I am sure it'll be ok. Usually if you stay in contact with them and don't blow them off for a long time it will be OK.
0.0 Yeah but i am usually so meticulous about those things.  I hope they don't charge an overdraft fee.	1.0 I would call them. They usually give you some credit for that.
0.0 i have a presentation tomorrow. I am ready for it.	1.0 That's good. I assume you have studied hard and are prepared?
0.0 for the past two weeks I have bee working on it and this week I have been practicing it 	1.0 Good luck! You will do great!
0.0 I once called my girlfriend's mother mom by accident.	1.0 Haha, I'm sorry but I had a little laugh at that. It reminded me of the time I did that to my teacher in school. I was embarrassed, but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it's a common thing that happens, since they're female authority figures that you can easily mix up.
0.0 Exactly, especially since we were only dating for a few months! I felt so awkward but she just laughed it off.	1.0 Yeah, she knew what you meant. She probably forgot in two minutes, while you've thought about it for much longer. The best thing to do there is to just show off your sense of humor and ability to make fun of yourself and not take yourself too seriously, which it sounds like maybe you did.
0.0 The pigeons keep coming into the house a pooping all over the place!	1.0 That's gross, why are they coming in?
0.0 Well they are actually my pet pigeons. They are the beautiful white ones with a fan tail. But they sometimes like to come inside to see if they can munch on anything.	1.0 You should probably avoid feeding them if you want a clean house.
0.0 Oh, I am so sad that my family could not come and visit me. I miss them all so much. Why is life so busy for everyone these days?	1.0 I sure wish it wasn't. I live far from my family and they can't even make time for me to go to them. So I feel for you, it is very sad.
0.0 Family should come first, right? The people of today are just becoming more isolated and lonely. I wish everyone would wake up!	1.0 Absolutely first. Especially when you don't live close.
0.0 Recently I had a very good customer service experience with my cable company. Not only did they fix the problem they gifted me free premium content for a year!	1.0 I bet it wasn't Comcast! They wouldn't even give you a cup of water for free.
0.0 That's so funny! I was so surprised too but really happy. I might even pay for the services when my free year is up.	1.0 I am glad you had a nice experience! Its difficult to find such a company that cares about its customers!
0.0 My dog eats other animals poop. I have seen them eat goat, duck and cow poop. I hope they don't get sick.	1.0 Oh, wow! That is crazy, have you talked to the vet?
0.0 The vet says that this can be normal but to make sure that I give them their worm pills regularly. 	1.0 I thought it would be normal. Good thing to be cautious. 
0.0 Last night there was a terrible thunderstorm. I unplugged all my computers and electronics. Then there was a loud bang and I heard my electrical box make a loud click. I think my house was electrocuted!	1.0 Well it is a good thing you unplugged everything!
0.0 Yeah! I learned my lesson from experience. We get pretty crazy storms out here. 	1.0 That is a good lesson to learn early, I am glad everything turned out okay for you!
0.0 I cannot wait until the weekend is here! I'm going skydiving for the first time!	1.0 That sounds amazing!  But terrifying too lol
0.0 I am not nervous yet but I for sure will be when it's time to jump out of that plane! Oh, what am I getting myself into, lol.	1.0 I admire you!  I don't think you'll regret getting this experience
0.0 When I was a kid I used to steal candy from the local 7/11 with my brother. We never got caught from the store but my parents found all the wrappers hiding in our room.	1.0 Hahah that is funny. Were your parents angry?
0.0 Yes, they demanded to know where we got the money to buy all that candy. We lied and said it was from a birthday party at school. Haha	1.0 Haha did they believe it?
0.0 A friend borrowed some video games of mine	1.0 nice, what system do you play on?
0.0 Xbox primarily, I'm hoping he'll get everything back in one piece	1.0 i really enjoy video games as well
0.0 I cannot stand my neighbor's dog's barking, its never ending	1.0 That's the worst! Have you tried talking to your neighbor?
0.0 i have, that what makes me so mad, he just smiles at me while I tell him and he does not do anything about it	1.0 You might try contacting the authorities, though I don't know if it would help. 
0.0 I found some of my old toys that I had passed down to my younger brother today while cleaning up his closet.	1.0 thats awesome! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family
0.0 It really was! It brought back so many wonderful and touching memories.	1.0 did he enjoy the toys>
0.0 The first time my girlfriend invited me to her father's house, I was super anxious.	1.0 Yeah that can be nerve racking! How did it go?
0.0 He mostly speaks French, and although I understand it perfectly I have trouble speaking. In the end it went well, and he was super easy-going and made me feel like family.	1.0 That is good! Are you guys close now>
0.0 I spent hours reviewing notes and course content to prepare myself for a few trials that a company wanted me to go through.	1.0 Good job! Do you feel pretty prepared?
0.0 I felt super prepared and I ended up getting the job just last Thursday!	1.0 WOWZA! Congrats! Is it a job you can build a career out of.
0.0 In a way yes and no. I'm teaching online, and my major in University is Education at the moment. So it helps me in school, and looks good on a CV for a full-time teacher position in an actual school someday in the future.	1.0 Oh thats good! Thanks for teaching. :)
0.0 Thank you for appreciating teachers!	1.0 My mom is one so i know how important you guys are.
0.0 My friend is so lucky, he always seems to be winning lotteries and gambles of sorts.	1.0 Man.. i need some of that luck!
0.0 Same here. Just last week, he won over $400 playing slot machines, and I really wish that could've been me.	1.0 Wow thats awesome! i never win anything like that
0.0 I really appreciate an artists talents. It is pretty incredible what beauty they can create!	1.0 I agree! I wish I was able to make things
0.0 It is really fun to create things, anyone can do it! But talent I think is a gift from God.	1.0 For sure you are born with those types of talents!
0.0 i was channel surfing and ran across the old Batman tv show, brought back memories.	1.0 That is cool! I love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television. I sometimes watch old shows on youtube that I used to watch as a kid. Love it!
0.0 same here, I loved watching Batman as a kid and could not wait to get home from school to watch it.	1.0 I used to watch the Wonder Years after school. I love watching it until this very day. 
0.0 When I was a little girl I would have to wear shoes with holes in it to school. Everyone made fun of me all the time. My family could not afford much.	1.0 that must have been embarrassing, I hope you weren't to traumatized
0.0 I think it is a good trauma cause to this day it keeps me working hard for my dreams so that I will never have to be in that place again.	1.0 that is good to hear, it was a motivation to succeed, a great character building 
0.0 i was sad to see my favorite tree had been broken in the storm last week	1.0 Aw man that sucks. It must have been a crazy storm.
0.0 it was pretty bad but i think the tree was already dying	1.0 How big was it?
0.0 I am very fearful of dying. I know it will come one day, I just hope and pray it doesn't hurt so bad.	1.0 You shouldn't think about death whilst you're alive! Just live each day to the fullest. 
0.0 Yes you are right but it is hard to not think about it when there is so much death going on around the world and we have to hear about it through the media.	1.0 Yes but death comes to all of us someday. So I think its best we enjoy our life whilst we are blessed with it. 
0.0 Last week I really had to rely on my friend to keep his word.	1.0 That is a good test of friendship.  Did he keep his word?
0.0 Yes in the end, he showed up and help me fix my car. I am really glad that he did.	1.0 It is such a blessing to have good friends on whom you can depend.  
0.0 next week I find out if i got the promotion at my job. I have my fingers crossed.	1.0 Nice! I hope you get it, I'll cross my fingers for you also! Do you think you got a good chance?
0.0 i do not know, i feel like i have done all I can to get it, but you never know	1.0 That's all you can do, but if you worked hard, I'm sure you will get it!
0.0 Last month cleaning out the attic I found a old box of photo albums that had belonged to my mother.	1.0 Oh cool. Were there any good picture in there?
0.0 So many good pictures. It was great reliving all of those old memories, many I had forgotten about.	1.0 Well that's nice. I am glad they were happy memories for you. 
0.0 I just got a new haircut, lets say this, I do not like it.	1.0 Oh boy.  I've gotten quite a few of those before.  New hairstylist?
0.0 no, same style from my barber who always cuts my hair, for some reason he did a terrible job	1.0 That's odd.  I would've told him so and asked for my money back. 
0.0 yesterday, i was drinking a glass of milk. When i put the glass back down, a fly was swimming in the milk	1.0 Ohhhh, disgusting.  What did you do?
0.0 first i did not know what it was, than i realized it was a fly, i was about to throw up	1.0 I bet, what a terrible feeling!
0.0 i know, flies are filthy creatures  and plus they produce maggots, yuck	1.0 Oh man, your making it even worse.  I never even thought about that.  Now I want to throw up.

0.0 A few of my co-workers said they'd be absent next week	1.0 Oh my, I hope that doesn't mean more workload for you.
0.0 Yeah, I hope we don't get a ton of work while they're gone	1.0 Maybe you should ask for overtime pay just in case you do get more work!
0.0 I have to take a plane trip next week, I'm not looking forward to it and I have to take a plane trip next week, I'm not looking forward to it.	1.0 Yeah, flying can be scary.
0.0 i know, just the idea of being in a plane up in the sky, scares the bejesus out of me	1.0 Hopefully it isn't a long flight.
0.0 I left my young daughter with my friend. I totally trust her though, she will be a great mom someday!	1.0 thats awesome that you trust her
0.0 yeah she is a great person.  she is a little younger than me.	1.0 its hard to find good people you can trust with your kids nowadays
0.0 One time my cat got ran over by a car	1.0 Oh no! Thats horrible. Were you driving?
0.0 No, it was some person driving recklessly!	1.0 Oh Gosh that is horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.
0.0 Last year during the spring, our area got record rainfall. My basement ended up getting flooded and destroying many of my childhood things and keepsakes.	1.0 That's the worst! Because now you'll be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there. That must be an anxious feeling. 
0.0 It really is, it just sucks losing all of those things. They were like my connection to the past.	1.0 Yeah, I'm not quite a hoarder or a packrat when it comes to those things, but I do get sentimental with some physical objects. If I lost them, I'd feel like it would be an itch I couldn't scratch, because I couldn't replace what I lost. Hopefully you can work past it somehow.
0.0 I am at peace with myself after taking a nice hot shower	1.0 Oh man, thats the best feeling in the world. Getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets.
0.0 Yes! I feel like a new person!	1.0 It's such a wonderful feeling, I should take a shower soon too.
0.0 what kind of saturday is this, i mean sure it's a relaxing one but damn i really blew it on the budget plan	1.0 How did you you go over your budget?
0.0 i spend it like maniac i am so disappointed in myself...	1.0 I hope you can have better self-control in the future.
0.0 I Really really can't wait! next week is the week! i finally get to see my love 	1.0 awww. that is good news!
0.0 i know! i am so happy about this! and i really can't wait, we are going to go on a cable car too	1.0 how long has it been seen youve seen each other?
0.0 i am just absolutely mind boggled, i just brought the coffee 3 days ago! and it's ALREADY FINISHED! WHAT 	1.0 Oh gosg. Do you have some greedy roommates or something?
0.0 just greedy? more than that, who the hell finishes a whole 500g of coffee in 3 days !	1.0 Hahahaa good point. Maybe try hiding your groceries.
0.0 have you ever had that one person who never ever disappoints you?	1.0 yea i have
0.0 me too, she's recently going through a lot and despite all that, she's working hard everyday for us and i am just so happy and lucky to have her	1.0 thats great, happy for yo
0.0 ever just feel so isolated in a room and alone? what a weird day	1.0 literally me right now actually
0.0 same, it's just such a slow day too, but one thing that is making me hopeful is tht next week i am going to travel to see fiance	1.0 must be nice to have someone that loves you
0.0 ...i am truly utterly worthless, i couldn't even submit my work on time	1.0 What is going on with your work?
0.0 i had an assignment to submit but i didn't submit it on time, i am so disappointed in myself 	1.0 You can do better next time I believe in you!
0.0 i am so looking forward to the day we pass from this world and go to heaven	1.0 Ouch.  Why? 
0.0 because  i am a very faithful person and i trust in my god!	1.0 Oh I see.  Very interesting that your faith makes you want to die though.
0.0 tomorrow is my first university day and i'm very nervous	1.0 its not so bad, it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there
0.0 i hope i won't get lost but i'm so bad with that, i always get lost. 	1.0 once you figure the way it just becomes routine
0.0 whenever you feel so hopeless, so distance and you feel like nothing ever matters, just remember to trust in the universe, for it has a plan for you	1.0 You are so right, did you read that somewhere?
0.0 no, i just came up with this philosophy while facing an existential dilemma 	1.0 That is cool, have you studied any philosophy in school?
0.0 do you ever just feel so grateful that you're alive?	1.0 Yes, I feel that every day.
0.0 it's the most amazing feeling ever right? it feels like the universe gives us everything.	1.0 I wish people understood how precious life really is.
0.0 i threw my laptop the other day and i already regret it	1.0 Why did you throw your laptop?
0.0 because i was very pissed off, i wasn't able to work .	1.0 Sometimes I lose my temper like that too.
0.0 3-3, final game decides it all, final game till promotion, time ticking, palms sweating, final minute and just as we are about to win it all, to finally reach that noble masters rank, my team mate fails to make the correct decision and we lose, it all just crumbles to the ground like rocks falling from the sky, my dream gone 	1.0 wow thats vivid, what game was this?
0.0 league of legends, my other addiction, other than my fiance 	1.0 ah yes league, love hate relationship with that game but after 4 years it can really still tilt me more and more
0.0 i was super late for my meeting on tuesday , i got so embarrassed 	1.0 Oh no, I hope it wasn't an important meeting.
0.0 it was actually, and because of the traffic i couldn't make it	1.0 Sorry to hear that, were they understanding about it?
0.0 my wife has been very sick recently and i am making the soup that is famous with our family recipe and she is slowly getting better	1.0 I'm sorry your wife is sick.  What kind of soup is it?
0.0 it's called lentil soup and we make it a special way with cumin spice and love 	1.0 That sounds quite delicious if I must say.
0.0 ever feel so full of emotions when looking at old pictures?	1.0 Yeah.  reminds me of the good old days!  
0.0 for me it's when you get more than just nostalgia, when you get sad, happy and sentimental 	1.0 Yeah same here.  I remember one time awhile back I took some pictures of when the aliens landed in my backyard.   That was some good times!
0.0 i am just so scared of what is going to happen in the future, i need to make money, have a house, own a car, and other materialistic good because  i am a person of the 21st century and i cannot afford any of this so i need to get a job, but all these jobs are paying me next to nothing despite my masters degree in computer science, what to do?	1.0 Yikes, that's a tough one and I can definitely feel your pain on the job market. I think either network your way to a higher pay job (depends on connections) or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees.
0.0 ummm? excuse me? do you know people earn a lot from computer science, it is not my degree for sure, it's this corrupt world we live in that's the problem	1.0 Yes but the market is quite flooded with CS degree holders. It's hard to get something unless you are specialized I think. Unfortunately I don't see society changing any time soon.
0.0 life is beautiful isn't it?	1.0 Life is the most beautiful thing.
0.0 are you happy with the way things are? i am enjoying every second	1.0 I live every day like it's my last.
0.0 i hate when that happens, i was suppose to be the on who was first, who was suppose to go first in the line, but instead my friend ended up going first	1.0 Waiting in line is the worst.
0.0 but it was in the line for university classes, i am so jealous 	1.0 I hope you got your classes.
0.0 i feel like there is nothing that i can't do, i feel so powerful!  and smart! i just implemented a kmeans algorithm with my own method  	1.0 Sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself!
0.0 yup i am !  so so confident and i think this is a good trait to have	1.0 I agree that it is as well. In most situations, it can work to one's benefit.
0.0 feelsbadman, some one in this absurd family ! WHO KEEPS ON TAKING MY BLOODY SHOES! 	1.0 I don't understand what you are trying to tell me. Is this a joke?
0.0 no, i am angry! imagine every morning you wake and someone in your family takes your shoes because they want to make you angry	1.0 Why would they want to do that?
0.0 it sure does bring back a lot of fond memories as you go for a walk past your old neighbourhood 	1.0 I can imagine the flood of emotions.
0.0 yup, many memories from the past, the good, the bad	1.0 I hope it was worth visiting.
0.0 pen, check, notepad, check! i am going to kill this social event today! i am going to leave 30mins earlier too	1.0 Sounds like you are prepared. I like the confident attitude. Go get them!
0.0 i'll sure do that, it's going to be fun too, do you go to social events?	1.0 I would love to come with you to yours. LOL, I just invited myself.
0.0 i don't know how to feel, i've been working so hard the past few months but i feel like i am not getting anywhere, still at the same place as i was 	1.0 I completely understand. Maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries.
0.0 maybe, but i also need a plan because if i continue like this, i won't get anywhere for reals	1.0 Are you looking for a new job?
0.0 can i really do everything alone? i just feel so useless	1.0 That's not true I'm sure. Do you have any friends to hang out with?
0.0 no, i don't like people, they make me lose more hope in the plane	1.0 I can understand. Maybe connect with some like-minded people online? 
0.0 last week my friends and i ordered pizza while at their house, after an hour of eating the pizza i pucked everywhere on his couch, i feel so bad and grossed out	1.0 ewww that's gross!  Did you help clean it up?  And what was in that pizza anyway??
0.0 god knows what was in that pizza, but i helped clean and the mess was still showing, but he said it wasn't a problem 	1.0 He seems like a good friend.  
0.0 ... everything seems to be everywhere, i am just scared out of my mind of the future	1.0 The future certainly can be scary.
0.0 are you not scared of the future?	1.0 I am curious for what the future holds.
0.0 my mother got a big cake and left it in the fridge for us to eat later, i selfishly took it all upstairs and closed my door and ate all of it while watching anime	1.0 Oh wow, the whole cake? Has she found out yet? Was she mad?
0.0 she hasn't yet, we're suppose to have it later tonight, but how disappointed she'll be when she comes back from work and sees that the cake has been entirely devoured by me... 	1.0 If you can and have time, I'd try to get a quick replacement and explain to her. Maybe she'll understand.
0.0 i created this math formula yesterday for uniquely identifying words! and i am so happy with myself	1.0 Oh cool.  How does it work?
0.0 it seperates the ascii values of each character and adds them up to give a number, then it divides  them by their length and then it does something else which i will keep a secret :P	1.0 Oh that's easy peasy.  Sometimes I only have to wipe once when I go number 2.  
0.0 i never got the chance to get promoted at work even though all my colleagues did!	1.0 Oh man, I would be so jealous. When will it be your turn? 
0.0 i am envying them. i don't know , i'm working very hard as well.	1.0 I think your boss should give you more recognition in that case!
0.0 i care a lot about my family and always want them to be happy	1.0 That's good!  You're awesome!  Family is what is important
0.0 family should always come first. 	1.0 I agree!  
0.0 i am very ready for my first semester in university!	1.0 ready for all those ice breakers? those amazing crazy party? what are you hoping to do this year?
0.0 i am really hoping i can make some good friends, and just learn about everything i don't know a lot about you know?	1.0 yeah defiantly, my best advice to you is to learn and focus on your studying and always expand in knowledge that's the one thing we seniors always wish we had done   
0.0 i was very angry when i learned about what happened	1.0 what? what happend? why are you angry?
0.0 i'm angry because my mom and my sister had a fight and they aren't talking together. that made me very mad.	1.0 really? was it about something very stupid?
0.0 I play guitar as a hobby but rarely play in front of other guitarists.  I only feel comfortable doing it if the people around me play worse or not at all.	1.0 I think that's a kind of natural reaction, especially if it is just a hobby. I would have a fear of being judged.
0.0 Exactly!  I always feel there's less chance of embarrassment if you're the best in the room.	1.0 Definitely. I feel the same speaking foreign languages. It's more of a self-conscious thing.
0.0 i'm looking forward to next week, i'm going on a holiday with my fiance!	1.0 that does sound like fun! where do you guys plan on going?
0.0 well, we are going to turkey! i've heard some good things about that country i'm very excited	1.0 that sounds like a good time. not the usual country you see people vacation to
0.0 i have a lot of hope for the future. i'm going to get married soon, and everything is going to be amazing!	1.0 That's awesome! It's so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything.
0.0 isn't it? i don't see negative things in life, i try to always look at the bright side.	1.0 I think you have the perfect outlook. I hope I can strive to maintain something like that as well.
0.0 i am sad because my brother failed me.	1.0 what did he do yolo?
0.0 he couldn't keep his promise with me. he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn't and that made me sad.	1.0 this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!
0.0 my brother was sick and he puked in front of me, it smelled horrible	1.0 Oh, yuck! That's gross. Did you get sick too?
0.0 i didn't, but no one was home and i had to clean that up :(	1.0 that's rough! My husband always did with the kids when he was home.
0.0 i am moving out of this country soon and i'm worried about my university, because i'll have a lot of exams to do and not gonna lie i'm stressed out.	1.0 don't be! i know this is overused but trust me, it's not as hard as everyone else makes it to be, if you focus and aim for your goals, you will get it! i know you can do it!
0.0 that was very needed , thank you so much, i was really stressed because of it.	1.0 don't be, i am sure your fiance will always be right next to you and help you out
0.0 global warming is terrifying me. and i'm scared people aren't even realising it.	1.0 It really is, what can we do to help?
0.0 i don't know maybe starting by stop using all those cars ? i don't know i wish we could do something.	1.0 That'd be a good idea, we could all start biking.
0.0 i just delivered the best project at work! 	1.0 What was the project?1
0.0 the project that i worked on was to deliver a marketing speech for healthy eating	1.0 You must be an expert on nutrition then!
0.0 i am so hopeful for the future! 	1.0 What are you looking forward too?
0.0 i am going to see my fiance who lives in adifferent country 	1.0 Which country? that sounds fun, are you guys doing anything fun there?
0.0 i am travelling soon, but i am bringing with myself a lithium ion battery for phone replacement to the airport security, i am anticipating the security there so i may talk to the person at the desk to confirm i can take such an item	1.0 yeah. it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items
0.0 the website says yes! but my friends say they don't know if that's accurate so i think i need to double check once i am there	1.0 yes. hopefully all will go well
0.0 i am very happy, my best friend is getting married today	1.0 Are you his best man?
0.0 well , i consider him my brother, i don't know if he thinks the same, we grew up together.	1.0 I hope he does, being the best man is an honour and you're ready for it.
0.0 at work i ended up writing code that is able to detect words that are similar and detect their meaning and cluster them into groups of n clusters 	1.0 sounds quite interesting to code
0.0 it sure is! i used genetic algorithm as well as k-means and neural netwroking	1.0 oh dang i never really dabbled that deep when i did my small share of programming
0.0 i am nervous and scared of my feelings, i feel like in the future they will hurt me	1.0 What happened?
0.0 nothing so far, but it's what migh thappen in the future	1.0 I hope all goes well so you're as happy as possible.
0.0 i saw one of my old friends today	1.0 That's good! I hope you had a good time?
0.0 well it brought back a lot of memories, and it felt nice to see her after all those years.	1.0 Yes, it's great when you run into an old friend you haven't saw for a long time. 
0.0 so greatful to be given this wonderful life	1.0 What are you planning on doing with it?
0.0 build a life with my fiance and grow together and gain more and more knowledge 	1.0 That sounds so admirable, I'd love to see you grow to an amazing person.
0.0 in my room, alone and i am starving	1.0 why don't you go get yourself some food? or just order some?
0.0 i have, but the wait is so real you know?	1.0 oh god i get you! waiting for your food to arrive is real torture.
0.0 i saw a cat the other day it showed up out of nowhere i got really scared.	1.0 wow, spooky, what did you do next?
0.0 i just walked past it.	1.0 that must have startled you 
0.0 ... starving once again, this feeling sucks, it gets me all depressed, nothing to eat and the delivery is 1 hour late	1.0 You having money problems?
0.0 yeah! but i still ordered but the food delivery isn't here yet	1.0 I don't think I've ever had a delivery guy be that late. I'd be mad.
0.0 my cat really got on my nerves today! she pooped in the kitchen floor and that was the first thing i saw when i woke up	1.0 Oh, that stinks...literally! I have pets too so I know how you feel. My cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up!
0.0 it's the worst right?... really made me so so so mad	1.0 It is, I wished they could just use the toilet like we do!
0.0 i am so proud of my fiancee, she's been working extra hard.	1.0 thats good! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication
0.0 and seeing her reaching her goals and growing so much makes me so happy.	1.0 that does have to feel really good
0.0 I am very lucky that I live out in the country where the quality of life is so much better than living in the high stress cities	1.0 Yes, where do you live?
0.0 I live in Colorado with the mountains and fresh air with so many wonderful outdoor activities available.	1.0 I love Colorado. I visit all the time.
0.0 Sometimes I feel very happy that I am a US resident. When I travel to other countries everyone is so amazed that I am from the US. They treat you very differently because they think that the US is so great, rich and free.	1.0 Yeah, we have a lot to be thankful for.  We take for granted many of the perks of being a US resident!
0.0 That is for sure! I just wish other countries were the same. There are so many people suffering all over the world.	1.0 I agree. There is a lot of suffering.  I am glad people like you and I recognize that.
0.0 I am very happy that my popsicle business is finally thriving! I have worked so hard on it for many years.	1.0 That is great. Where are you selling your popsicle?
0.0 From my house and from a few local stores. I am not ready to make it any bigger than that.	1.0 I understand. Good luck.
0.0 I was so happy to come home the other day and everything was clean and dinner was already on the table. What did I do to deserve that?	1.0 You were probably just being you.
0.0 No, I think somebody wants something... I am just waiting to hear it, lol.	1.0 Haha! That's usually the case. : )
0.0 I lived in New York City for a couple of years and it is definitely a place where one can feel quite alone if you don't have family or friends.	1.0 I understand. Is your family living far from New York?
0.0 Yes, a plane ride away. But there was also a lot of cool things to see. I think it was a good experience but it would be better with friends and family.	1.0 It is always cool to have family and friends close by.
0.0 When I am in nature I feel good that this world is exactly as it should be. Everything is moving along to Gods plans.	1.0 That is a great mindset to have!  You must feel very happy and content!
0.0 Yes, when I am in nature. :) But when I come to the big cities I feel like it is the devils playgrounds	1.0 Why do cities make you feel that way?
0.0  feel so bad, I forgot again to fill the gas tank up in the car after I used it all. My friend is going to kill me!	1.0 Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas. 
0.0 I just seem to forget until I get home. Oh well I will just have to give her some money again instead. Oh she is going to be angry.	1.0 You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her! 
0.0 just got back from grocery shopping, The cashier gave me back $10 more change than I supposed to get	1.0 Did you give it back or just walk away?
0.0 i did not find out untill i got home, the store is kind of far and I think I'm going to keep it, but it's eating on my conscious because of that	1.0 Yeah, that is a hard one to deal with.  Maybe you should give it back so you will not feel bad about yourself.
0.0 I feel a little weird about looking at this house for sale. It looks haunted and I think something bad happened there, but not sure.	1.0 I would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place. 
0.0 That is a good idea. It is such good deal and I think it would not need much money to fix it up. But a ghost in the house is definitely a deal breaker!	1.0 Kinda makes you think even more since its such a good deal that people are just like get rid of it - deff look into it! 
0.0 When bad things happen I get too emotional. I think more than other do. Sometimes I think I am crazy.	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that...sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you don't get overwhelmed.
0.0 Yeah, I know. But in the moment it is hard. I guess I am just a very emotional person. Maybe I need theraoy, lol.	1.0 Therapy is a good thing. Its is nothing to be ashamed of.
0.0 I have faith that I will get pregnant soon. Why is it so hard? Isn't that what a women's body is built to do?	1.0 Maybe it isnt your body, but also your partners! Something to check into to see which end its coming from, but none the less it will happen! 
0.0 Yeah, more people are having these issues these days. I think it may be true that someone may be poisoning us through the water and food or something! It is a scary world!	1.0 It's hard to trust anything, even the oatmeal recently was put on the news that its high in cancer causing pest spray. 
0.0 I found a lost baby duck. The mother was no where to be found. I brought it home and took care of it until it was big enough to be let loose again.	1.0 Thats kind of you, did everything go well when you put it back into the wild? 
0.0 The duck flew away and was never to be found again. Hopefully he was reunited somehow with his family. I just hope so.	1.0 Sounds like it went well! 
0.0 I feel so upset when other people tell such horrible lies about other people. Some people are just cruel and are only out for themselves.	1.0 Yes, I hate those kind of people. They have nothing to do expect lying about other people.
0.0 Yeah, it is very hurtful. But what can one do? Get back at them? It just seems like you would go to their level. I guess it is better to just swallow it and move on.	1.0 I just ignore them. At some point, they stop but they understand that it is not working.
0.0 This past week my 3 year old son caught strep throat. I ended up having to miss the entire week at work to stay home with him.	1.0 I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he is feeling better. 
0.0 He is, i hated missing work, but that the sort of thing a person has to do for their children.	1.0 It is. Taking care of sick child is hard. Missing work is also hard. The things we have to do for our children.
0.0 My high heel broke in the cement the other morning and I had to wear them all day at work. Not a good day!	1.0 Sounds like something on a movie! What a work day right, my god. Bring extras next time? lol 
0.0 Yeah, from now on I will have an extra pair in my desk. Everyone was teasing me all day. It was so annoying!	1.0 I bet they were lol atleast you can laugh about it now. 
0.0 My father continuously gambles all his earnings away even though he has two minors to support.	1.0 That's very sad, has he considered getting help for his addiction?
0.0 Nope, he doesn't care and denies it's an issue. When I found out, I was too angry to look at him.	1.0 I can certainly understand your feelings, I hope he can somehow fix his habits.
0.0 My friends and I started playing Halo online recently.	1.0 Has it been a lot of fun?
0.0 Incredibly so. It brought back so many great memories from the times we played on the Xbox 360.	1.0 Oh yeah I remember those old Halo days too during my childhood, such a great game.
0.0 I feel happy to just stay in and watch a movie at home on a Saturday night. I have no desire to go out and party like most people I know do.	1.0 I understand that feeling. It wouldn't make sense for us all to want to do the same things, especially if you've partied before already.
0.0 Yeah, been there done that. I don't miss those hangovers on Sunday morning. Totally not worth it anymore.	1.0 That's cool that you know what you want from life right now and that you don't feel obligated to do things just because of norms.
0.0 Last month, finally, after years of working towards it, I was finally promoted into senior management at my job.	1.0 Oh that's great! Does it come with a nice raise?
0.0 Yes it did, and much better benefits. Seems like I finally got to the end of a very long road.	1.0 Do you kind of feel like there's no where else to go?
0.0 After working for years at a job I didn't like, and struggling in school, I found a new job that coincides with my Major.	1.0 I am so happy for you! All of your hard work paid off!
0.0 Thanks! For the first time in a long time, the future isn't looking so dark.	1.0 That is great accomplishment! I wish you well on your new path in life!
0.0 Last week at work, I went to sit down at my desk chair and completely missed it and fell straight into the floor.	1.0 Oh my...I hope you didn't hurt yourself.
0.0 Just my pride. My boss and a couple coworkers got a good view of me just flopping into the floor as documents and paperwork went flying.	1.0 Since you didn't hurt yourself I think I will have to laugh. It sounds like it was funny.
0.0 I know I should not feel like this but I feel so envious when I drive through the rich neighborhoods and I know that I will never be able to live there.	1.0 Yea, I feel the same way.  It's worse when you have to pass by them twice a day.
0.0 I have to pass twice a day too. Oh well, I should just be grateful for what I have now. I just can't help that feeling from creeping in though. Maybe I will buy a lottery ticket, lol.	1.0 Heck no.  Be envious that they were lucky enough to have their parents hand down all their money to them.
0.0 Last month my wife and I ordered our first new car with a delivery time of six weeks. 	1.0 Oooh, how exciting!! What kind of car did you get?
0.0 We ordered a new Ford Superduty pickup. This six weeks is taking forever.	1.0 I'll bet it is! Best of luck with your new truck!
0.0 In the 6th grade, a bird pooped on my back during lunchtime.	1.0 Indoors?
0.0 Nah we were having a barbecue outdoors. 	1.0 In the 6th grade? Where is this school?
0.0 In Quebec. All schools have a budget for extra-curricular activities and events. We had a barbecue once every year in June with free food.	1.0 Makes sense. I live in the states. We have no money for such things.
0.0 That sounds awful, all schools need a budget for activities for the students. Anyways I had no replacement shirt and I had to rinse it out and wear it for the rest of the day; I felt sick.	1.0 How big a bird was this. I dont remember anything from the 6th grade.
0.0 Last month, a buddy of mine bought a scratch off ticket and won $4500. I never win anything when I buy them.	1.0 Wow!! That's crazy. I'm like that though. I never win anything either
0.0 I mean I am happy for him and all, but I wouldn't mind some found money either.	1.0 haha right! Maybe you should buy a few and see what happens. You cant win if you don't play
0.0 Our puppy wiggled out of his leash. He ran toward the busy road and was hit by a car. It was awful	1.0 Oh god, I am so sorry. Is he okay now?
0.0 Sadly, no. He passed away at the vet a few hours later.	1.0 I hate to hear that. It is so hard to lose a pet. I hope you are doing okay through this.
0.0 coincidence, I too I'm taking a trip but a business one, I 'm not looking forward to flying	1.0 Do you not fly often? It isnt too bad.
0.0 a couple of time, but it truly scares me	1.0 Well if it is a bigger plane it isnt as bad. Just bring some headphones and listen to some comforting music.
0.0 The other day I forgot to take my anti-anxiety medication.	1.0 You have to be more careful next time, maybe you need a calendar to remind you.
0.0 I put an alarm on my phone, I just get so busy some mornings. At least it didn't affect me too bad until the next morning.	1.0 I am so sorry to hear, I am glad that it didn't cause a lasting effect.
0.0 I am feeling pretty good after my interview for a promotion at work last week. My boss told me I nailed the interview.	1.0 That is a fantastic feeling. I hope you get it.
0.0 Well I have almost twice the experience as the other two candidates, so I have a really good feeling about it.	1.0 Keep riding that confidence. It will get you places. It sounds like you deserve it.
0.0 The other night, drunk bicyclists were following me home and laughing on the sidewalk.	1.0 That must have been a bit scary, You should have called the police.
0.0 I wasn't too far from my home so I figured I could tough it out. I was pretty scared however, especially since it was nighttime. 	1.0 You cannot be too careful these days, i am so sorry that happened to you.
0.0 NASA released some free space posters a couple of months back.	1.0 Okay! Now that is interested, I would love to see them.
0.0 I think they have them up on their website, you should give them a look! I had them printed for a small fee and now they're up on my wall!	1.0 Oh really? I will be checking it out. I would love to have some.
0.0 Yup. The poster files are free, you just have to get them printed somewhere. They have a few different themes. I got Europa, Trappist-1e, Mars Explorers Wanted and "We Need You"	1.0 Free? That makes it even better, I will be getting me some posters.
0.0 Sweet! I hope you like them as much as I do!	1.0 I hope so too. Thank you so much!
0.0 Yesterday I found a massive spider in my room.	1.0 I am afraid of spiders. I would run and scream. What happened afterwards?
0.0 It ran off somewhere and I couldn't find it, even though I moved most of my furniture. I'm a little scared.	1.0 I would move out of that room. Maybe you need to spray the area.
0.0 There was a chance that it could rain on the day my best friends and I went camping.	1.0 Oh no! Did it end up raining? Did you take rain gear?
0.0 It barely did at night, but for the few days we went camping it was nice weather! I'm so thankful that it didn't, because we made a lot of nice memories during our trip.	1.0 That sounds like it was a lot of fun!
0.0 looks like we have something in common, when i walk through my house, the rooms are empty. There are no one here but me	1.0 Im sorry to hear that it can be hard ;/
0.0 i know, i am trying to cope but the emptiness is unbearable	1.0 Yeah i would get a pet
0.0 I was watching over my girlfriend's cat while she went away on a little trip.	1.0 That is so sweet of you. I love cats, you must be a caring spouse.
0.0 I like to think so, thanks! Unfortunately, the cat wanted barely anything to do with me and I felt so isolated.	1.0 The cat didn't like you, oh dear. I am so sorry that happened. You need to spend more time with the cat.
0.0  Ever since I started taking medication for anxiety and depression, I've been gaining weight. 	1.0 I have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it
0.0 I have, she said I'm okay because I still have a healthy weight. I've been a skinny boy all my life, and I still am but this extra chub has me feeling down.	1.0 Well you could always work out and turn it into muscle
0.0  No matter who comes to the door, my dog barks.	1.0 Its a good guard dog then
0.0 In a way yes, but not really. As soon as anyone ENTERS the house, he turns into a huge lovable pup and wants them to pet him. He's such a nuisance but I love him.	1.0 What kind of dog is he
0.0 I was driving down the highway when I saw a car in an accident. It seems they hit a cow! Oh my!	1.0 Animal accidents can be really bad!
0.0 I felt so bad for the poor cow. It seems no one was hurt except the cow. :( The car was pretty damaged though.	1.0 At least no one else was injured, but it is sad about the cow. 
0.0 my pet dog is getting older. I know one day she won't be around anymore	1.0 Just cherish the moments
0.0 I will, but just the thought of it makes me blue	1.0 It will be okay
0.0 I put in a lot of effort and energy and I found a new job!	1.0 What kind of job is it
0.0 It's an online teaching position and I feel so good about myself. 	1.0 That is a nice job I am sure
0.0 I came home drunk from the bar and stole my neighbor's package that was sitting out.	1.0 Uh oh! Did you get in trouble?
0.0 No, but I felt like a jerk when I gave it to them the next day and had to explain what happened.	1.0 That is good that you gave it back and were able to admit your mistake. I am sure they appreciate that.
0.0 With all the money I've been saving up, I should be able to purchase an Oculus Rift Virtual Reality system soon!	1.0 Awesome, congrats! I'm not too familiar with the Oculus Rift, is there a particular game you're eager to play?
0.0 Hmm maybe Robo Recall, a game about fighting robots. Otherwise I have to find out what games are available!	1.0 Robot games are always fun. I bet you'll have a great time!
0.0 I went on a new bike trail the other day, it was super fun but also a little scary.	1.0 Ooh how so? Were there a lot of hills and sharp turns?
0.0 Yep, exactly. I also have a new bike so between the new route and the new bike, I was totally terrified of wiping out. So I took it slow.	1.0 I see. Do you think you'll be going back on that bike trail?
0.0 Absolutely! And now that I know it better, I won't be so scared. I'm heading back out there Tuesday, can't wait!	1.0 I hope you have tons of fun and enjoy a safe trip!
0.0 I made a new friend at a convention I was volunteering at. I was shocked.	1.0 What kind of con was it
0.0 Otakuthon 2018. It's about anime, Japanese culture and videogames. I was volunteering for the MSI booth (a PC-Gaming company).	1.0 that is really cool! I like in Texas so i cant go to stuff like that
0.0 I participated in a ropes course with my colleagues, we had to learn how to trust each other.	1.0 That sounds amazing!  How did everyone do?
0.0 Pretty good. The hardest part for most of us was the blind trust fall, but in the end most of us learned to put faith in each other.	1.0 Awesome!  Hopefully what you guys learned in the ropes course translates over into the workplace.
0.0 I let my little sister go into my wallet and grab my credit card so she can order something online for herself.	1.0 Why did you do tht?
0.0 She's very trustworthy and I knew she wouldn't steal from me. It was also something she needed and didn't have the money to get it yet.	1.0 That makes sense, you are a good older sibling!
0.0  I once drank six pints of beer in a night and ended up getting very sick.	1.0 I would imagine, that is a lot to drink!
0.0 It really is. I felt so bad about my actions, but it hasn't stopped me from doing it at least one other time.	1.0 I get that, well I hope you feel betternow!
0.0 I never learned how to ride a bike.	1.0 why is that?
0.0 My parents never saw the importance I guess. 	1.0 I get that, did your friends know how to ride bikes?
0.0 They did, but I was always too scared and not confident enough in myself. I thought I would fall and really hurt myself.	1.0 Well it is never hard to learn if you give it a shot
0.0 My girlfriend made the cutest and most touching card for my birthday.	1.0 Aww that's sweet. Did you cry?
0.0 I almost did. It was hard holding the tears back.	1.0 Why hold them back? It okay to cry lol
0.0 My cat has terminal kidney failure. There's no cure.	1.0 Oh, I am so sorry! I used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes...we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him. I can relate to how you feel... 
0.0 It really sucks. It's fairly common in cats and I sort of knew the diagnosis was coming but that doesn't make it any easier. I'm sorry to hear about your dog.	1.0 Our pets are our family...it's not easy to see them suffer..I feel for you. And thank you about our dog.
0.0 I received horrific news from a best friend recently.	1.0 Oh no, what happened?
0.0 They had tried to commit suicide. It was very hard to hear but thankfully they are getting the help they need.	1.0 That is terrible, you must have been devastated, I hope he find the help he/she needs.
0.0 you know at work, one of my coworker is always singing to himself, it bugs me	1.0 Oh dear, but are you allowed to sing at work? That must be so annoying.
0.0 it really is, he thinks he knows how to sing, i would not be so annoying if he knew how to sing 	1.0 He needs to just sing in the shower. Tell him to quit singing.
0.0 One time I slipped on a banana peel	1.0 Haha no way, I thought that only happens in cartoons!
0.0 Yep, everyone was laughing at me	1.0 I'm sorry but I probably would have, too. Hopefully you didn't get hurt though!
0.0 My neighbor was recently diagnosed with a pretty bad form of cancer.	1.0 That is unfortunate, is he doing any chemotherapy ?
0.0 I'm not entirely sure of the regimen, I didn't want to ask too many questions. But I've been bringing pre-cooked meals over for her and her husband when I get a chance to help them out a little.	1.0 Well I hope everything works out for him!
0.0 One time I was waiting all day for the mail man to deliver my package	1.0 What were you waiting for!
0.0 I was waiting for my computer monitor!	1.0 Nice!  The anticipation must have been killing you!
0.0 I ran out of laundry soap the other day, when I went to the store I grabbed a brand I hadn't used in many years.	1.0 How well did it work out for you?
0.0 Oh it worked fine, but when I pulled my laundry out it surprised me how the smell of that soap reminded me of my life all those years ago when I used it regularly. Isn't it weird how scents can do that?	1.0 Wow!  That is such a great feeling!  I love when good memories come back to me!
0.0 One time I saw my husband looking at another women	1.0 o no what did you do?
0.0 I slapped him and beat up the other women	1.0 o no im not sure that was the best response
0.0 I was leaving the bar the other day with my boyfriend and tripped on the step just outside the door.	1.0 Oh No! Did you get hurt?
0.0 Well, physically not so much, just a light scrape on my knee. But man my pride got wounded bad!	1.0 I bet that was a little embarrassing. 
0.0 I was a cigarette smoker for nearly an entire decade. In retrospect this is slightly embarrassing. 	1.0 Don't be embarrassed. You know that you had a problem and you are better now for it
0.0 Right. Not much that can be done about it now. I enjoy having more money now though for sure!	1.0 That's understandable. I wish you the best in staying smoke free!
0.0 Being a parent so far has not been anywhere near as difficult as I expected it to be. My daughter is awesome!	1.0 That is great to hear that things are going well for you.
0.0 Thanks that means a lot to me!	1.0 I am sure that things will continue to go smooth since you have a positive attitude about it.
0.0 I was waiting to hear back about a potential job offer, I really wanted the job.	1.0 How long has it been since the interview?
0.0 That's the thing, my anxiety and excitement started the moment I first talked to the company, it was driving me crazy. But I ended up getting the job!	1.0 Oh well congrats and good job!
0.0 My friend just won $500 in scratch-off lottery tickets!	1.0 Oh that is awesome for your friend!
0.0 Oh totally. I'm happy for her but part of me was also a little envious, I hate to admit.	1.0 Yeah I can understand that. I would feel the same.
0.0 I took on a challenging speed bike course recently that was above my skill level.	1.0 That was probably not a good idea, how did it go for you?
0.0 It actually worked out amazing! I knew going into it that I'd practiced a lot and had built up my skills, so I was sure I could do it even if I was a little hesitant.	1.0 Well, you never know if you can do something till you try. I am glad you were able to do so well.
0.0 When I was interviewing for a promotion at my job. I did all I could to get ready for the interview. 	1.0 That can be kind of scary. How did it go?
0.0 It went great. I having put in all the work ahead of time to get ready, I knew exactly how to answer the questions they had for me. 	1.0 Awesome, congratulations! It just goes to show how great things can happen when you're prepared.
0.0 At my job a coworker took credit for a job I had completed. Once I found out, I went straight to my boss and got it straightened out.	1.0 Good job.  Your coworker sounds like a shady little b**ch did you let him/her know what's up
0.0 I found them and gave them a piece of my mind. What kind of person does something like that.	1.0 For real.  Glad you had enough self-respect to handle it, most people dont'
0.0 We went camping this summer and my boyfriend made fun of me for packing so much stuff.	1.0 Aww haha how many bags did you bring
0.0 It honestly wasn't *that* much stuff, I packed it well. But the joke's on him, he felt dumb for making fun of me after we needed a bottle opener and I just so happened to pack one.	1.0 Heey there you go...sounds like you're the resourceful one
0.0 This couple just moved into my building and have been having loud parties almost every night!	1.0 That sounds awful!
0.0 Yeah, it's really irritating. I don't mind people having fun but come on, every single night? It's really ticking me off.	1.0 Have you tried talking to them about it?
0.0 An actual ice cream man came through my neighborhood! I didn't think they still exist.	1.0 I don't think that I have seen/heard one of those since the 90s... Possibly the early 2000's at the earliest! Crazy, I didn't know that they still exist either!
0.0 Right? Seeing the kids come running out really made me miss when I was little and got all excited about the ice cream man!	1.0 I loved that too!
0.0 I am content with my life. I have nothing to complain about, luckily!	1.0 That is wonderful to hear, good for you. There's way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy. It's nice to hear someone is doing well and happy.
0.0 Agreed. I have to actively distance myself away from the drama of reality but doing this makes me happier. Not sure if this is ideal but that's ok!	1.0 Distancing yourself from the negative things sounds like a totally healthy way to insulate yourself from that stuff.
0.0 I was cleaning out the attic last week, and came across a box of old photo albums and some of my childhood things. I sat for hours just looking at old photos.	1.0 Aw, that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you. 
0.0 It really did. Seeing all those old faces I haven't seen for years. It was a great experience.	1.0 Did you share it with anyone else?
0.0 I recently applied for a job with a  new company. It would be such a step up for my family if I got it.	1.0 Nice, a step up is always such a relief. Do you feel confident you'll get the job?
0.0 Some, I did well in the interview. Just trying to keep spirits up while they make their decision.	1.0 Well I hope you get it. Good luck!
0.0 I'm waiting to hear about a lucrative job opportunity, it would pretty much be my dream job.	1.0 That's great. How long are you going to have to wait?
0.0 Not sure, hopefully I hear this upcoming week. I feel pretty good about my chances so that's making the waiting a little easier.	1.0 I am glad you are so confident about your prospects. I hope you hear something very soon from them.
0.0 Most of the decisions that I made as a teenager were kind of embarrassing in retrospect.	1.0 I think we've all been there...I've done my fair share of dumbassery
0.0 I feel it. Most of the bad decisions were fun, at least.	1.0 Ha YOLOOO
0.0 I can't wait until all the trees change colors and the weather starts getting cold. I love Autumn!	1.0 I know right! I noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited! Is autumn your favorite season, too?
0.0 Yes! My absolute favorite! It's not too cold and not too hot and there is so much beauty all around! It is soon time to get all the winter clothes out.	1.0 I don't mind winter either but you're so right, the temperature is just right during fall.
0.0 I worked really hard on this project for work and it totally bombed.	1.0 Awe, sorry to hear that. I am sure you did better than you think.
0.0 Well, not really according to analytics. I was really let down by the fact that it was a flop but I'm not going to let it drag me down too much.	1.0 That is a good attitude. Better luck next time!
0.0 The house is all cleaned and ready for my guests. Wow, I was cleaning all day!	1.0 I was doing the same thing!  Hard work but so satisfying when you see the results!  Who is coming to stay?
0.0 Yes, there is no better satisfaction, in my opinion, than a clean house. :) My sister is visiting with her kids. They are staying for a week here at my house. I am sure the house is going to be trashed in the end.	1.0 I completely agree.  Mine can get trashed in 10 minutes flat from the kids.  ha ha. Oh, how fun!  I hope you have a wonderful time!  Yeah, you'll probably be cleaning all over again by the end of it but its worth it.
0.0 My neighbor sits out on his balcony butt naked sometimes.	1.0 That sounds pretty disturbing.  Have you called the cops?
0.0 No but that might be a good idea. It's just an awkward and gross situation.	1.0 I bet.  I wonder what he is thinking.
0.0 I have fixed up house to the best of my ability. I feel very certain that it will sell very quickly.	1.0 I certainly hope so, Why do you want to move?
0.0 I am moving to a smaller house with a big yard where life will be a lot easier. Less house to clean and more time outside. :)	1.0 That sounds great, That is how I like my houses to be too.
0.0 I feel confident that eating a fruitarian diet will give me more energy and happiness.	1.0 Hmm, don't you need fat and protein in your diet also?
0.0 I have done a lot of research and so many fruitarians are thriving and feeling the best they ever had in their life. There is fat in avocados and avocados are considered a fruit..	1.0 Oh I hadn't even thought of avocado. Well good luck with the diet, I hope it works for you!
0.0 I wrote an email to a family member I haven't spoken to in a long time and I wasn't sure how they'd take everything I said in it.	1.0 Oh wow! That is a brave thing to do! Your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it. How did it work out?
0.0 Yep, it was full of emotion and a lot of things I needed to get off my chest. I was quite nervous waiting for a response but it turns out I had nothing to worry about. She was really glad I spoke up!	1.0 Awe that is great! I am glad there was a happy ending!
0.0 I get so mad when the local kids throw eggs at the front doors of houses in my neighborhood. It is so infuriating!	1.0 Oh man I'd be mad too...you should wait outside with a paintball gun 
0.0 Yeah! I wish I had the time for it! I am going to buy one of the web cams and catch them in the act. I am going to teach them a lesson! But I love the paintball idea! That is great! 	1.0 Yup gotta lay down the law
0.0 I moved into this new house and was woken up with this horrible screeching noise in the middle of the night.	1.0 Terrifying! What was it?
0.0 It turned out to be the sump pump, I guess it was old. But yes, it scared the daylights out of me!	1.0 Oh good. I bet!  I wouldn't have been able to go back to sleep after that!  Do you have to replace the pump?
0.0 I made a really inappropriate joke about a coworker to some other people I work with and it got back to him.	1.0 Oops. I hate when that happens. Did they say anything to you?
0.0 No, but the person who told him confessed. So I decided to be the bigger person and apologize to my coworker before things got too out of hand. He actually wasn't that upset and appreciated that I owned up to it, but I still felt bad for it, mostly that I did it behind his back.	1.0 That was really nice of you to apologize like that. Some people would have just ignored it. I know that could have been embarrassing.
0.0 I got my work done early on Friday so I got to spend the day trying out a new bike trail on my new bike!	1.0 that sounds exciting! Do you bike a lot?
0.0 I've only recently started getting really into it. It sounds kind of corny but getting out there on my bike makes life just really... satisfying. Calm.	1.0 Doesn't sound corny. We all need a hobby to relieve stress!
0.0 I miss being able to take my children to the park.	1.0 How come you can't take them anymore?
0.0 they are all grown up. 	1.0 Awww, well maybe you'll have grandchildren that you can take one day!
0.0 I studied all night for my final exam"	1.0 That's intense. I hope you did well!
0.0 I did! I got an A and I am so proud and happy !	1.0 Congratulations! That's great news. Well deserved
0.0 the neighbor's dog barked all night and kept me up, let's say I am not very happy right now	1.0 I totally understand. The same thing happened to me last week. I thought I was going to lose it!
0.0 i understand the dog is being a dog, but the owner does nothing about it even when i tell him about it	1.0 Right, I had to end up calling the homeowners association on them
0.0 My cat somehow figured out how to open the cabinet and stole a bag of treats.	1.0 Wow that is very clever. I would have never thought that could happen.
0.0 Right? I wasn't even mad about it, I was astounded by his ingenuity.	1.0 That is incredible. I wonder what else you can train him to do.
0.0 I feel like my husband is the sweetest man in the world	1.0 That is great! Hopefully he continues to be
0.0 I think he will. He puts up with me, and sometimes i can be a pill!	1.0 Lol i'm sure you have to put up with him as well so its even
0.0 I was so upset when I had to put my dog down last month	1.0 Oh no. That's so sad. Was she sick for long?
0.0 Not really. She was old and we woke up one day and she could not use her back legs. It was very sad.	1.0 I'm sorry. At least she had a good long life.
0.0 During my first year in grad school, my basement apartment flooded. EVERYTHING was destroyed and I had to start over fresh.	1.0 That is awful! Did you have insurance to cover everything?
0.0 Thankfully, yes!! It took several months to replace everything that I could -- but even things, so many things I just simply couldn't replace. 	1.0 Yeah that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you. 
0.0 I am in charge of booking meeting rooms for outside companies at my job. Last week, I made a big mistake and accidentally gave a group a room for free when they should've paid $100.	1.0 Oh no! I hope you didn't get into too much trouble by doing so!
0.0 Thankfully, not too much! I was simply mortified because this was one of my main responsibilities and I managed to mess that one up so badly!	1.0 To be fair, everybody makes mistakes and it's bound to happen even to the best of us!
0.0 My brother and his friends invited me to a party tonight.	1.0 Sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties. Do you want to go?
0.0 I just came back from it! I'm actually still a little intoxicated. I must say it was a lot of fun, we celebrated my birthday and I felt very loved and happy.	1.0 Happy Birthday! I'm glad you were able to have fun and be surrounded by those that love you.
0.0 I drank a lot and told my girlfriend that I would definitely sleep with her best friend if she was down to do so.	1.0 What was her reaction to that
0.0 She was a little sad and surprised, but we had been talking about threesomes for a long time now so she understood. Regardless, I felt very ashamed the next day.	1.0 I am sure she will forgive you
0.0 My husband and I have been watching TV together each night--once the baby is asleep, of course.	1.0 That sounds like some nice relaxing quality time
0.0 It really is! it's the only time in the day that we're guaranteed to have some time together, just us. 	1.0 Have you ever passed out together watching tv?
0.0 Not yet - but I'm sure it'll happen at some point!	1.0 How old is your baby?
0.0 8 months old - but by looking at him, you'd think he was a two-year-old. Thanks for asking!	1.0 And how long have you been married?
0.0 My wife and I found the perfect house for sale and we excited to put a bid in on it.	1.0 that is exciting! will it be your first house?
0.0 Well it would have been, but someone got a bid in before us and it ended up being sold. My wife was so sad.	1.0 that is no good! hopefully yall will find a better one
0.0 I let my friend watch my dog last weekend.	1.0 You must really trust your friend! How did that turn out?
0.0 It was good, he (the dog) seemed really happy when I got back. He said that he let my dog out a bunch and even took him to the park!	1.0 Good to hear that it went so well. Do you think you'll let your friend watch him again?
0.0 I once almost ruined my husband's master's thesis presentation--something he needed to pass to get his degree.	1.0 Oh no, what did you do?
0.0 I started coughing--badly. He and everyone else stopped to look at me and make sure I was okay. He was so distracted after that!	1.0 Don't worry, from what you said it doesn't sound like you almost ruined it. It wasn't something on purpose at least.
0.0 I was expecting a surprise birthday party today.	1.0 Lol that makes a lot of sense?
0.0 Yeah I had a few hints. My expectations were somewhat true; my brother's friend celebrated not only my birthday party, but two other birthdays today. It was wonderful!	1.0 well that sounds fun!
0.0 Last week while my wife were out for dinner at a restaurant, I got up to use the restroom and walked by the kitchen. I saw a cook pick up a piece of chicken off the floor and put it back on someone's plate.	1.0 Haha caught red handed!
0.0 We proceeded to leave the restaurant, but not after informing the manager, very loudly, about the incident. 	1.0 Yeah, I wonder what their bathrooms are like if that's their service
0.0 I hope I do well when I start school soon, I can't help but think it will be too hard.	1.0 Don't worry about it you will do fine. Kindergarten isn't too hard. Just don't eat the glue.
0.0 Lmao. It's actually my junior year of mech engineering.	1.0 Oh I see. My mistake. I was wondering how you could type and spell so well for a 6 year old. Well good luck in college!
0.0 My husband's been searching for a professional job but can't seem to land one after interviewing.	1.0 Did he try to get another diploma in this profession area?

0.0 My little sister has been going all across the country this summer, spending lots of time on money on pop concert after pop concert.	1.0 Interesting. How do you feel about it? Do you find it fun and interesting, or wish she were more responsible with her money?
0.0 Mostly I'm a bit frustrated that she's got so much money to blow on these concerts! And to travel all across the country!	1.0 Yeah, I can understand that. Sometimes when you're not in a position to enjoy yourself because you're busy being tied down with responsibilities, it's easy to get mad at others. Whatever you can do to spin it positively, I would suggest that. Being negative about it will only make everyone's lives worse.
